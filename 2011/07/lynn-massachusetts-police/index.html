<p>If you have been reading my posts on my site you will know that almost 2 weeks ago my 2008 CBR 600RR was stolen.  I called the <a href="http://www.lynnpolice.org/" title="Lynn Massachusetts Police">police in Lynn, MA</a> to report the stolen motorcycle and informed the dispatcher that I needed to have an officer sent over because the motorcycle had been stolen.  The dispatcher told me that they were not going to send an officer over to the home for that as there was paperwork that I needed to fill out.I headed down to the station thinking there would be miles of paperwork to complete because they did not want to bring it to the location, take my report and have me fill it all out there.  However when I got there the dispatcher took my name, had me fill out 1 piece of paper and gave me a copy of that paper which was the police report.  He then informed me that I needed to contact my insurance company.I started the process with the insurance company and was a little let down that the police wanted to do nothing about it other than fill out a piece of paper.The real kick in the balls though was that the very next day my girls neighbor locked her keys in her new Honda because it auto-locks and she left her keys on her driver seat.  The police made sure to head over there and use their little tool to pull back the window and unlock her doors.  What is the world coming to when a crime is committed and they expect you to go down to the station but will run to you to unlock your car doors.  I guess I should have told them I locked my keys in my car and when they got there reported it as stolen.</p>
