<p>I am sure I am not the only guy who is blasted via email and websites such as LinkedIn by recruiters who have not even taken a second to look at your resume.  Today I was blasted about a C# .NET position which is NOT on my resume at all.<pre>Joseph,Hello! How are you? I wanted to reach out - we are currently working on numerous C#.NET opportunities in the Greater Boston Area.  If you have any referrals or know anyone that is a great developer that I could start a referral chain with, I would greatly appreciate it!! If you are interested yourself, even better -- please let me know when I can get in touch with you!<a href="mailto:--Debdcoleman@rezulttechnology.com">--Debdcoleman@rezulttechnology.com</a>*Contract - Lexington, MA*Permanent - Lexington, MA*Contract - Woburn, MA*Contract - North Andover, MA*Permanent - North Andover, MA</pre>I in-turn replied with my response:<pre>Hello Debbie,Please do not just blast me with these spam messages. Nowhere on my resume does it state that I have ever done .NETYou are not doing your job as a recruiter if you are just blasting people <em>hoping</em> that someone will pass you a referral so you can fill your position with the least effort on your part.While you don&#39;t have any initial connections that does not stop you from contacting user groups, job boards, etc. Hey it looks like you&#39;ve figured out how to use LinkedIn, now all you have to figure out how to do is YOUR JOB!Please remove me from your mailing list and ALL <a href="http://rezulttechnology.com/" title="Rezult Technology">Rezult Technology</a> lists.Thanks,Joseph Crawford</pre>I am not sure if I was a bit too harsh but the fact is I am sick of deleting useless emails from recruiters who are hoping to catch that next big fish.  It kinda goes in-line with an article a friend of mine wrote: <a href="http://www.jvmediadesign.com/blog/business/how-not-to-get-a-clients-attention-with-email/">How not to get a potential clientâ€™s attention with email</a></p>
