<p>On Monday I was browsing through the App Store on my lunch break and was a bit surprised when I stumbled across a game called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/harbor-master-hd/id363658120?mt=8">Harbor Master</a>.  The surprising part hit me when I was looking at the details page in the store.  The game play seemed very familiar and very much like that of Flight Control HD.  The concept is the same as with Flight Control, you have to direct the boats to the proper docks based on the color of the cargo the boat is carrying.  I must admit that both games are very addictive, I mean to the point where I find myself playing them whenever I get a chance because you know &quot;I just have to beat my high score!&quot;.Though the game play is very similar at first (and I was surprised they are made by different companies) you will quickly see that Harbor Master while following the same concept takes it&#39;s own direction with the game play.  When you first start a game you will see an empty harbor which will quickly fill with boats (if you play on high speed like myself).  Some of the boats are small speedboats carrying a small amount of cargo and some are rather large cargo ships.  You will notice that the larger the ship and the more cargo it has aboard the slower it will go.  When you have a large ship with a lot of cargo headed into port you will notice that it moves at a slower rate than after it unloads.  The attention to small details like this is what makes Harbor Master a truly great game.Another twist is that you will see tornado&#39;s (I think that&#39;s what they are) appear from time to time.  Any ships that are set on course for a harbor that hits the tornado get spun around and loses all sense of direction.  You will have to direct this ship back to a port trying to avoid the path of the tornado.  This tends to make the game a bit more challenging especially when you have a lot of boats on the screen and more than one or two are hit by the tornado.  Another great twist is that a ship can be carrying several different types of cargo.  You will notice in the screen shots below that there are some ships carrying multiple types of cargo.  First you have to dock the ship at one dock to unload that type of cargo and then head over to the other dock to finish the unloading process.&lt;!--more--&gt;<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM1.png"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM1-150x150.png" alt="" title="Harbor Master 1"></a><a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM2.png"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM2-150x150.png" alt="" title="Harbor Master 2"></a><a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM3.png"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM3-150x150.png" alt="" title="Harbor Master 2"></a><a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM4.png"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/HM4-150x150.png" alt="" title="Harbor Master 4"></a></div>While the game play for both games follows the same concept I feel they are rather different once you play them both for a short period of time.  The one fact that I loved about Harbor Master is that it was &quot;free&quot; for the iPad.  I am not sure why it is free for the iPad since the iPhone version is priced at $1.99.  The only thing I can think of is that it is a promotional price so if you want the game on the iPad I would suggest you go grab it immediately.  I am not sure what the Harbor Master price will be once they remove it from being free but I would expect that it would remain closely priced to Flight Control HD which comes in at a mere $4.99.Overall I would give this game a 4 out of 5 rating.  While the game play is nice I would like to see more to this game.  I have not been playing for long and my high score is only 51 but I have only seen the single harbor map.  It would be great if these games would provide more levels initially with the games and maybe down the road offer more levels for sale maybe 4 for $0.99.I know I would not mind paying a bit more for added levels if the game were to come with 4 or 5 from the start.  I am just a bit disappointed in some of the iPad games because they are shipping with a single level.</p>
