<p>I was recently in contact with a recruiter who thought that I was unprofessional and/or that I did not appreciate all the hard work they put in for me during a previous job search, they also implied that I was not acting in a professional manner because their clients expect them to represent the most professional developers.If ANY of you that have personally worked with me feel this way in the very least &quot;I am sorry.&quot; please reach out to me personally and I will clear this up any way possible.  I personally feel that I have always acted professionally when dealing with <em>anyone</em> not only recruiters or potential employers.I was also informed that I was ignoring their emails and or not responding to them at all.  I actually went through my sent items and found that I in-fact did reply to them and they may have missed the message on their end.  If you think that I have not replied to any of your emails I am <em>not</em> intentionally ignoring you, I am sure I sent a reply.  Please reach out to me and we can clear this up.Thank You,Joseph Crawford</p>
