<p>Once the AppStore opened on the Palm Pre I put my card in place so that I could order apps that I may want.  In the past I have had no problems while purchasing apps.  I have bought Tweed, Spot the missing pieces, JogStats, Air Hockey, Spot the Difference, and Conmigo. However while on the train this morning I decided to buy an app and as an end user it seemed like everything went smooth.  It asked for my palm password, asked if I wanted to purchase the app and then it downloaded the app.  Nothing out of the ordinary happened during the transaction, however when I got to the office this morning this is what I found in my in-box.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Transaction Failure Notice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your previous transaction could not be processed. Please contact your financial institution should you have any questions.</p>

<p>You will still be able to purchase more applications in the Palm App Catalogue in the future. To do so, update the payment information in your account before placing a new order.</p>

<p>We appreciate your patience and hope you continue to enjoy using the Palm App Catalogue.</p>

<p>Best regards,Palm App Catalogue Team</p>

<p>It seems like Palm is allowing all transactions failed or not to actually download the app as if it were paid for…  Let’s hope they fix this problem real soon, I have already reported this to the palm app catalogue support team.</p>

<p>**** UPDATE ****On a side note Palm, I suggest that you look into other live chat applications for your website.  Using something that is Windows only is not very smart since there are a lot of Linux / Mac desktops out there now.  I had to load up Vista in a Virtual Machine just to contact your support reps.  At the very least provide an email address where your support staff can be contacted.  I searched for support and all I came up with was the Live Chat with your reps.</p>
