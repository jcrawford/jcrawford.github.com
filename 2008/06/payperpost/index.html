<p><img src="http://tinyurl.com/23nm6h" alt="">It has been a while since I wrote about <a href="http://posties.payperpost.com/">PayPerPost</a> so I figured I would tell all of you about it again.  I joined this website a while back now and have been using it on and off for content in this blog.  If you have never heard of them you should check them out.  Why not get paid for writing your honest opinions of products and services?</p>

<p>I was a bit skeptical at first however I have been paid for every post that I have included on this site.  Will it make you millions?  Doubt it.  But it will help with the hosting costs associated with running your site.  I am sure if all you did was write about <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g">PayPerPost</a> topics you could bring in quite a bit of money but that is not how I use it.</p>

<p>You will not see anything on this blog from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g">PayPerPost</a> that I have not used or done in the past.  I will not make up stories just to post about something like refinancing your home or 0% interest credit cards.</p>

<p>So far I hope all of the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g">PayPerPost</a> content has been helpful, let me know in your comments.  If you run a site, this is a good place for ideas on what to write about and also a good source of income if you push yourself.</p>
