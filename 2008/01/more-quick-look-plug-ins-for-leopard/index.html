<p>With the integration of Quick Look into Leopard we all thought it would be great if there were 3rd party plug-ins developed for it.  Previously <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/2007/11/27/leopard-quick-look-plug-ins/">I wrote</a> and told you about the zip and folder quick look plug-ins. Today I found out that there are 2 websites that are dedicated to archiving QL Plug-ins.  <a href="http://www.qlplugins.com/">http://www.qlplugins.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.quicklookplugins.com/">http://www.quicklookplugins.com/</a>.  It seems that both of the sites archive the same plug-ins so right now it does not matter which site you use as your source.  There seems to be quite a fair amount more of plug-ins being developed.  One of my favorites is the BetterZip as it has a nicer interface than the regular zip and it also allows you to view many many different archive formats and not only the zip format.</p>

<p>THere seems to be everything from adobe to textmate integration plug-ins and I cannot wait to see what else people come up with.  You can preview movies, flash movies, images, archives, documents.  They even have ones that will highlight your code if you are viewing a document with programming code.</p>
