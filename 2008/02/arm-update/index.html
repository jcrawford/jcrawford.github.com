<p>As most of you know I broke my arm about a month ago.  Last week I had to have surgery because it was not healing properly.  Today I went in for my 1 week visit and had the splint removed.  My arm is so bruised it&#39;s all yellow and even the palm of my hand is bruised.  All of this is par for the course according to the orthopedic surgeon I had (who reminds me of Doogie Howser) as he looks like he is in his late 20&#39;s but is actually in his 30&#39;s.  Anyway I have posted a picture at the tail end of this but I warn it is not for the faint hearted.  It is a picture of my incision so if you do not want to see it, do not click the read more link.<br>
