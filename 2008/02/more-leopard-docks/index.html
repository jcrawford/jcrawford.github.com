<p>Ever since the release of Leopard people have been taking the initiative to hack their Docks so that they were not using the same old dock that everyone else has been.  With the release of CandyBar 3 they have made it very easy to change the look &amp; feel of your dock but it also allows you to change other system icons.  CandyBar 3 is not free however it has a $29 price tag.  With CandyBar you can download tons of icons and docks from the <a href="http://iconfactory.com/freeware" title="IconFactory">repository</a> that they have created. Today I read about a program called <a href="http://www.dativestudios.com/docklibrary/" title="Dock Library">Dock Library</a> which I have not tried.  It looks like this is only for customizing your Dock so CandyBar has the upper hand with me so far.</p>

<p>In the same article that I found the link to Dock Library I also found a link to a site called <a href="http://www.leoparddocks.net/" title="Leopard Docks">Leopard Docks</a>.  There are a ton of different docks for you to choose from.  You can use these docks in both applications that I have stated above.  In CandyBar you just click on the Change Dock Appearance tab and start dragging the images from finder into the appropriate spots in CandyBar.  Once you are done you can save the set as an iContainer to share with other CandyBar users.  I have created the iContainer for the Garden theme which you can <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/Garden.icontainer">download from here</a> if you so choose.  I have to say that the best theme I have seen so far would be the Litho theme by Anthony Piraino.  You can grab Litho System from <a href="http://iconfactory.com/search/freeware/litho">this page</a> along with all of the extras which make it even nicer.</p>

<p>Leopard Docks has some nice Dock themes and Icon Factory has some nice themes to choose from.  The one thing I really wish was that there was a very large repository of full blown themes for Leopard.  Even if they were just images in a zip file I could create iContainers to use with CandyBar.  I would like to see a theme where the wallpaper, system icons, dock etc were all rolled into a theme that looked good together.  Anyone know of such a repository on the web?  </p>
