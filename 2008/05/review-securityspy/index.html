<p><img src="http://josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/mainlogo.gif" alt="SecuritySpy" title="SecuritySpy">Over the last few days I have been reading up on CarPuters and the things you can do with them.  As you might have read in my post about the <a href="/2008/05/21/a-carpc-why-would-you-want-that/">CarPuter</a> there are a lot of things you can use them for.  I was reading the forums over at <a href="http://www.mp3car.com/">mp3car.com</a> and I found this post about a <a href="http://www.mp3car.com/vbulletin/gps/97190-dashcam-video-gps-speed-imprint-court-date-soon.html">Dashcam video with GPS Speed overlay</a>.  I was intrigued to find a solution that I would be able to use with the Mac Mini I plan to integrate.  During my search I found a great piece of software called <a href="http://www.securityspy.com/">SecuritySpy</a>.

This software will support multiple cameras at one time and the best part is is has motion detection.  You can adjust the sensitivity of the detection so that you are not recording the neighbors cat walking through your yard.  I think I will buy this software when I integrate my CarPuter though because I can mount a small camera to the car and record video while driving down the road.  If I really wanted to I could capture video from all angles of the car.  Why would I want to do that?  Why wouldn&#39;t I?  What if I was in a car accident and the only way to prove it was not my fault was by having this video in court?</p>

<p>Now another great feature of this software is the ability to upload the video&#39;s to an FTP server.  What if my car is stolen or someone breaks into my house and steals the computer.  While they are caught on camera it will do me no good if I do not have the video that catches them in the act.  Uploading to an FTP server is a really nice feature.  It can also send an e-mail to you letting you know that motion has been captured.</p>

<p>Overall I think this is a great piece of software and well worth the cost of the application.  Below I have outlined the costs for using the software.  They do charge more for however many cameras you will have in use.</p>

<p>The costs for using <a href="http://www.securityspy.com/">SecuritySpy</a>[$58.80] SecuritySpy - single camera use[$147.00] SecuritySpy - use with up to (and including) four cameras[$294.00] SecuritySpy - use with up to (and including) eight cameras[$588.00] SecuritySpy - use with an unlimited number of camerasAs you can see the cost increases with how many cameras you plan to use.  You must ask yourself really how much your possessions are worth to you.</p>
