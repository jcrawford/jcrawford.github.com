<p>Today I noticed a post on the NYPHP User Group mailing list, it was a post about the unseen Saddam video.  Ofcourse out of curiosity I had to look.  This is just hilarious, I would not want to be the camera man.  Take a look for yourself and laugh untill it hurts :).  I am surprised the camera did not fall and the camera man have a heart attack.<object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.metacafe.com/fplayer/382178/saddam_the_unseen_video.swf" /><embed src="http://www.metacafe.com/fplayer/382178/saddam_the_unseen_video.swf" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>
