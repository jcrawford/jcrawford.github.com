<p>The other day I was browsing around YouTube and saw that someone had posted a video of them drawing people.  At the end it said &quot;I can draw YOU&quot; and told me to upload a video.  I uploaded a short video of Paxton and I.  I was shocked at how fast the turn around was.  I figured it would be a few weeks before anything was done (if I was even choosen).  Tonight I got an email that there was a new comment so I had to check it out.  She told me that the video was uploaded, and when it started it also contained one of my favorite songs for the background music. Be sure to leave some comments letting Anwen87 know what you think of their work.Overall I think she did really really good on the sketch, I am going to try to buy the sketch from them.  I think it would look great on my wall.  Check out the video.&lt;!--more--&gt;[youtube=<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JwHmpZaK60%5DI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JwHmpZaK60]I</a> just cannot get over how good this sketch is.  I wonder how long it took her to do.  It couldnt have been more than a few hours.  I really do hope she is putting her talent to use to generate some income because she is very talented and could be making money doing something she loves.Thanks Again Anwen87 I really appreciate it and if you have a website let me know what it is so that I can direct some of my viewers to see your work ;)For now if you would like to see more of her work you can check out her YouTube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=Anwen87">profile page</a>.</p>
