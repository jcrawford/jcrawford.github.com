<p>Last night I installed Parallels and today I installed Windows 2000.  While it is great that you can run windows on OSX in a Window or Full Screen mode.  Coherence mode is what takes the cake.  When running in this mode you can literally run windows applications within OS X.  Below you will see a screen shot of Internet Explorer running on my system.<div align="center"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/ie-on-os-x.gif" alt="IE on OS X"></div>This is a really nice feature and makes Parallels well worth the $79 that they are charging.  I am excited to see how the rest of things run such as games, etc.  There is only one issue that I have found with parallels and that is when you are running in Coherence mode and you insert a CD or DVD windows tries to control it and OS X does not see it.  To fix this you have to temporarilly disable the optical drive.  I hope they fix that so that both OS X and windows will see the drive, otherwise it&#39;s just a pain in the butt.I did say that I would be running a benchmark on my old system and the new system and I have.  I have to get things setup but you will soon see a post with the benchmark results.</p>
