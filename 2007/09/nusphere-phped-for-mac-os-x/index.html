<p>Back in the days where I used Windows for my primary OS I used to use PhpED as my web development IDE from time to time.When I finally made the switch over to Mac OS X I found that I could not run PhpED under OS X and had to find an alternative.  I started to use Zend Studio and even with the low level of support I continue to use it.&gt;  Parallels Virtual Desktop enables our Mac and Linux users to take the full advantage of PhpED features, including the latest additions.From drag and drop of the Macintosh PHP file to PHP Editor as shown on the pictureToday I received an e-mail that stated that you could now run PhpED under OS X, it seems a lot of people have been asking for it.  I was so disappointed when I went to their website and found out that you can only run it on Mac OS X / Linux while running under Parallels.  Now Parallels is Virtual Machine software which will allow you to run different Operating Systems in a virtual window.  While they do take it a step further with coherence mode you still have to run windows in order to use it.The main question on my mind is if you use PhpED as your primary development software why would you run OS X in the first place.  Not to mention why would you do your development under a virtual server.&lt;!--more--&gt;I believe this will raise their sales a bit but why not develop the software to be cross platform or better yet, stick with your original business plan of offering it to windows only.Did they decide too early in the game to support only windows?  With the rise of Apple computer sales will it hurt their sales?  I doubt it.  If you are dedicated to using that as your primary development software you probably wouldn&#39;t make the switch over to OS X.Just a bit of disappointment when I read the <a href="http://www.nusphere.com/products/php_ide_mac.htm">NuSphere Page</a>.</p>
