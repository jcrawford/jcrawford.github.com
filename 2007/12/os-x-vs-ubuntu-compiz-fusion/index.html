<p>Before I bought my first mac through the years I have always jumped between windows and Linux distributions. Linux had not had the best user interface like OS X, it was just never a nice on the eyes.  Last night my roommate was telling me about something he had seen a while ago called beryl.  We found out that the beryl project had merged with the compiz project to create <a href="http://compiz-fusion.org/">compiz-fusion</a>.  An excerpt from the compiz website tells you exactly what it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Compiz Fusion is the result of a merge between the well-known Beryl composite window manager and Compiz Extras, a community set of improvements to the Compiz composite window manager. Compiz Fusion aims to provide an easy and fun-to-use windowed environment, allowing use of the graphics hardware to render each individual window and the entire screen, to provide some impressive effects, speed and usefulness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although that tells you what it is in a nutshell there is nothing like seeing it in action to fully understand it so be sure to watch the YouTube video that I have embedded into this post.  It adds some pretty slick visual enhancements to the window manager and in my opinion it&#39;s pretty sexy.  From what I understand this runs below the window manager so I think you can use it with any window manager you so choose.  A lot of the effects that you will see are mostly just things you can do when you get bored but this is the future of operating systems.  I have seen some stuff like this in OS X but not anything nearly as cool.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">          I just love how you can move the windows around really fast and make them jiggle like JELLO.  As soon as I saw this I looked into the possibility of installing this side by side with OS X.  I asked in a few IRC channels and people decided that they needed to be sarcastic and tell me sure you can, you just have to put the monitors next to each other. I finally figured out that it will install without any issues on a Mac, you just need to use a boot loader.  My choice is rEFIt which I used in the past when I did a dual boot windows setup.  I attempted to install Ubuntu using the CD ISO that I downloaded.  It would not work for me.  Not because I have a fancy Mac Pro but it is the fact that I decided to go all fancy with my mouse and keyboard.  I have the Apple wireless keyboard and mouse which both run on blue tooth.  This evening I will have to go pick up a cheap wired keyboard and mouse just to get through the installer.

<p>The blue tooth stuff will work with Ubuntu once I get the OS installed, I guess the installer just will not detect them for me.  I cannot wait to get this installed and see how fast it runs on my system.  If I can get everything to work well with my work VPN connection etc (I&#39;m sure there will be no problems) I might even decide to make Ubuntu my primary OS...  Sorry Apple.  If I do fall for Ubuntu I might just have to buy a cheap PC to install it on.  I would sell my Mac Pro but with the way I can jump between OS&#39;s I would prefer to keep it for the future :)<br>
