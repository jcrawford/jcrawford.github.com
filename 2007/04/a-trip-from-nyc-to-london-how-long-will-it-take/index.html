<p>You know if you wanted to travel from NYC to London you could do so in a plane and it would only take several hours.  The jokers over at Google Maps have a different idea for you.  Take a look at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;saddr=New+York&amp;daddr=London&amp;layer=&amp;sll=40.714167,-74.006389&amp;sspn=0.09069,0.159302&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=4&amp;om=1">this map</a> which is a map with directions from NYC to London.  Be sure to look at #23 in the directions list.  Could you imagine? This is too funny!</p>
