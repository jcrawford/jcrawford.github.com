<p>I was searching around today and I have found out how you can get rid of that reflective glass shelf.  There are 2 commands you have to execute in terminal</p>

<p><code>defaults write com.apple.dock no-glass -boolean YES</code></p>

<p><code>killall Dock</code>  </p>

<p><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/dock_no_glass.jpg" alt="Leopard Dock without Glass Reflection">I found that when executing those commands you tell the dock that you want no glass.  Now it gives you a dock with a background image as shown. The closest i could get to a total transparent dock is to remove the white border from the image to the right.  I cannot seem to find the file in which the dock uses for the gray background.  I am sure it is just another image in the resources directory.  What I did was open bottomX.png where X = 1-5. and created transparent versions in the same size and used those for my dock.</p>

<p>As previously stated in a previous post someone has already created a small utility called <a href="http://www.eternalstorms.at/utilities/2dornot2d/" title="2DOrNot2D">2DOrNot2D</a> which will allow you to alter the appearance of your dock.  Currently it only allows for switching between 2D and 3D viewing of the dock but I am sure more is to come.</p>
