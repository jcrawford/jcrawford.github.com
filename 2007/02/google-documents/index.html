<p>Yesterday a client of mine contacted me on behalf of on of their clients.  They needed to have something like Google Spreadsheets developed for internal use on their server.  I guess the client was told that they could no longer use Google because the data was too sensitive.  I looked over the Google application and as always they make heavy use of Java-Script and AJAX.I collected the required information and sat down to come up with the estimate.  The client cannot be named due to a Non Disclosure Agreement however they are a very large company.  I provided them with the estimate which they found to be way too much ($15k).  I told them that if they did not want exclusive rights to this application we would be able to drop the price down to $5k however we could not go any lower.They wanted the ability to collaboratively work on a single document without the document being locked.Â  Our solution to this was to store the spreadsheet data in a database and when they wanted to save the document export to an excel document.Â  They also needed the ability to import the documents.Â  Of-course they wanted all the nice features of being able to resize the columns by dragging the handles, the bold, italics, etc.Â  They pretty much wanted all features of Google Spreadsheets aside from the formulas.I am not sure what the client was thinking because that application will take lot of  time developing, not to mention testing and QA time.  They decided that even the $5k was too much.  They were probably looking more along the lines of $1-2k.  Do people seriously think you can get an interactive application like Google Spreadsheets for that amount of money?  I mean at least something that is going to work good.</p>
