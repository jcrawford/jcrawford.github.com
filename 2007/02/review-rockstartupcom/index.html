<p>As most of my readers know I have started to do postings for <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g">PayPerPost</a> and only post content that I feel is relevant to the site.  However one thing I wanted to share with you is that PayPerPost does more than just run the PayPerPost site.  They also run a site called <a href="http://rockstartup.com/">RockStartup.com</a> <a href="http://www.rockstartup.com">reality tv</a> where they post video&#39;s of things that take place while they are at work.  Things that take place can vary from meetings, to weigh-in&#39;s.  Yes you heard me right weigh-in&#39;s.  They have started a contest in the office where the person who loses the most weight get&#39;s a prize.  They are taking video and updating everyone with what is going on at PayPerPost via the RockStartup.com website.<a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g">PayPerPost</a> is asking all of the Postie&#39;s what their favorite episode is and I would have to say <a href="http://rockstartup.com/episodes/episode_9.html">episode 9</a>.  I love the fact that  Ted get&#39;s &quot;reverse&quot; Postie Patrolled.  I have seen video&#39;s before where they go to a Postie and have them do a scavenger hunt in exchange for a prize.  If they found everything on the list they would get the prize.  This time however a few of the Postie&#39;s visited Ted unannounced at the PayPerPost headquarters and surprised him with a treasure hunt of his own.  Gotta love it when a company creates enough buzz for users to come out and see you like that.<a href="http://www.rockstartup.com/?utm_source=opportunity&amp;utm_medium=disclosure%2Bbadge&amp;utm_campaign=favorite%2Bepisode">
