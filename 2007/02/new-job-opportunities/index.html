<p>Over the last few weeks I have been approached with a few options for jobs.  I have been offered six figures to work from home as a PHP developer from different companies.  I have decided that I will be joining ERE to bring their company forward and into a LAMP environment.  ERE is a trade publication company who are currently using ASP 3.0 with MS SQL.  It was a tough decision but what ERE offers sounds great and I look forward to working with them for a long time.  They are offering &quot;stability&quot; which is really what I need right now.  The other company wanted to pay me as a contractor and I could be my own boss but they are a start-up (in a sense, they have been around for 5 years) and chances are they will be around in a year but there are no gurantee&#39;s.I have enjoyed working at eFashion Solutions and wish them all the best of luck.  They have a really great IT staff and I will miss working for them.</p>
