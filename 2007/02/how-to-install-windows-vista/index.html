<p>I was browsing YouTube tonight and I came accross a unique method for installing Windows Vista.  I had to laugh and I have to admit I feel the same way about Vista.  I have it installed with Boot Camp on my Mac Pro so that I can play games, but it seems to suck worse than XP.  You just have to see this video.  It&#39;s too much ;)  Let&#39;s hope most of the world uses this method when installing Windows Vista.&lt;!--more--&gt;[youtube=<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxQm3IsSKAo%5DNow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxQm3IsSKAo]Now</a> wasn&#39;t that just great ;)  This guy has a great sense of humor and I guess the ability to shred money :)</p>
