title: "Review: SwapThing.com"

A while back I was looking for a website where I could do some bartering for other's services or products.  I ran across [SwapThing.com](http://www.swapthing.com/ "SwapThing").  I registered for the website so that I could check out how it was setup and possibly find someone that I could barter with.  I have had the account setup for a few months and I have posted my services as a trade in exchange for a Mac G4 or higher laptop.  I have not heard anything from any of the users on the site.

I also went back to the site today to list 2 loaded PCâ€™s for trade in exchange for a Macbook Pro, however I was unable to complete the process.  I would submit the form with all of the correct information.  The site just started complaining about an ISBN not being supplied.  I was a bit surprised, since when does a Macbook have an ISBN?

When I first registered for the service I remember having issues like this as well when trying to list my first item.  After a few attempts it went through.  This time I tried 5 times and could not get it to go through.  Maybe there is just not enough demand for the service to make the site administrator fix the issues who knows.  They seem to be the most used site when it comes to bartering so I thought it was fairly odd that they would be having issues like this.

I know that if SwapThing fixed their programming issues they would have a good service to offer people.  The layout of the website is very nice, it is easy on the eyes and easy to navigate.  I would love to see them fix the programming issues they are having and see what the site really has to offer.
