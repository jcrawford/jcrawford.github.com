![Freshbooks Widget](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/freshbooks_widget.jpg)For a while now I have been looking for a good solution for online billing for clients that I have.  I have tried using Quickbooks and while that is a very nice application I just cannot access it from anywhere I am unless I have it installed on both my home machine and my laptop.  I did look into the online version of Quickbooks that Intuit offers however this was only for IE users.  Sorry mac users.  Tonight I have started looking at [Freshbooks](https://josephcrawford.freshbooks.com/signup/) and I must say that it is very nice.

I signed up for a free account but with as easy as it is to use I think I will be upgrading soon.  You can customize how your invoices will look, add clients, projects, tasks.  This is just the tip of the iceberg though.  They have a nice dashboard widget that Mac users can use to track time.  When you are developing you don't want to have to flip back and forth from a web page.  You just want to start the timer and then go back and stop it.  A web based timer means it is yet another window that has to remain open.

I am going to furthur explore the system but since it is free to try why don't you go [sign-up](https://josephcrawford.freshbooks.com/signup/) for an account and check it out.  If you do a lot of online work I am sure you will find it very useful.
