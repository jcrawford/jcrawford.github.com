title: "Review: Comcast support"
---
I am not sure what is worse calling into a support line and getting someone who can speak english and is utterly stupid or getting someone from India which you cannot understand.  Today I called into Comcast to get assistance with my iSight (it previously worked before the migration from Adelphia to Comcast).  It is leading me to believe that Comcast is blocking a port required by the iSight or iChat.  While on the phone with the guy who was utterly stupid I told him what was happening, here were his responses.> Oh you are on a mac, open system preferences.  Do you see the iSight listed there under Hardware?Are you trying to use the iSight with Comcast Services?Oh you need to contact your 3rd party video service provider as we do not block any ports, the company is like Vonage!I am not sure how much more laughter I could possibly get from a companies support staff.  The second response is just too much.  No I am using Time Warner, I just thought I would call and harass you for a while to waste time before I called them.  The last response in the above messages came from a senior agent.  HOW DID HE GET THAT JOB?  This is just too funny.  Once I told him it was video over AOL IM (what I am using through iChat) he insisted that it was not them and that it was something else.  How can 2 computers whos configurations have not changed all of the sudden stop working when the only thing that changed was the cable provider.I instantly requested to speak to a manager I cannot take these stupid answers from people who just want to hit the end call button but have to keep professionalism.  Before asking to speak to a manager I asked the support agent how the Senior Technician got his job because his answer to the problem was the most idiotic answer I have ever heard.  He basically said I cannot say much sir.  HAHA.I am currently on hold. do de do de doo, bada bap bap bah.They answered and this guy seems to be a bit more knowledgable but wants me to reboot my computer.  Oh wait I would have never guessed they are trying to blame my router as the issue.  I have to remove the router from the setup and try that.  Whew I wish I would have thought of that.  I told them I have already tried that and it did not work...  Well try again was the response.I am sorry but I have never had support techs ever be this incompetent.
