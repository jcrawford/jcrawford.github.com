title: "Review: Beginners JavaScript Programming on DVD"
---

So a few months back I wanted to learn more about web development.  Currently I am focused on PHP however i would like to be more well rounded and know more than just PHP.  I bought a few books about JavaScript and also a book on DVD.  I have been able to preview some of the Total Training videos for Photoshop, and they were very informative and they get the instructions through to the end user.  They were also very fun to watch, you could tell they were not low budget videos.  The book on DVD that i bought is called Beginners Javascript Programming on DVD by DV Press, Inc.  although I bought the item from Amazon.

I would never recommend this book on DVD to anyone.  The content (from what i was able to watch) seemed to be decent however i could not sit through the instructor.  He is so boring and bland and blah.  I am not quite sure how to explain it.  You would have to see it to understand, and I am sure that posting a bit of the course on here would violate copyright laws so I cannot do that.   You would think that if a company was going to record something it would not be so bland.  It's so bad that i could not get passed chapter 3.  The guy talks in the same tone constantly, it will just about put you to sleep.  I have this DVD sitting on my desk and i think i will throw it away.  I would put it on ebay but i would feel bad actually selling this to someone whether i know them or not.

I cannot speak about other DV Press, Inc books on DVD however if they have the instructor Harold Davis i would stay away from them.  DV Press, Inc. really needs to get some people who are not only good programmers but whom are good on camera as well.  In the future i may try another DV Press, Inc. book on DVD but it wont be with this instructore, and if the next is just as bad I won't purchase another DV Press, Inc. product
