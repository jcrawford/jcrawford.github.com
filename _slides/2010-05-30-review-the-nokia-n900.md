title: "Review: The Nokia N900"
---
I am writing this post from my new N900 which was provided to me by my employer.  I have been using the phone for the last few days.  At first i was a it concerned that i was not going to like the device, i will explain why next.  When i powered the device on the first thing i wanted to check out was the ovi store.  When it opened in the browser the first thing i saw was a nice message about having to update to Maemo 5 before i could use the store.  I tried a few times to run the update while at work but it was dead slow and the update process hung up on me a few times before it was successful.<!--more-->Once updated however everything seems to be running smooth.  I have installed several apps from the application manager but the one app i cannot get to install is Pidgin which is a real bummer for me.  I have noticed that while installing apps it appears to be hanging with no visiual progress.  I havew learned though that paitience is a virtue.  When i want to install a new application i start the process and connect it to the charger. At this point i walk away and find something else to do while i wait.  Generally when i go back it is installed bunless that application is pidgin.Today I even installed JoikuSpot which i had on my E72 previously and I was very pleased with the interface.  I cannot wait to get all my work stuff setup on the device, things such as email and communicator for messaging.After a few days of using the device rather heavilly I really like it.  The only thing i find annoying is that the touch screen is a pain to use with your finger.  Thank goodness it comes with a stylus.  I think I am a bit too used to the accelerometer and pinch zooming on Apple products.  While some apps on the N900 change orientation i found most dont.  There is also no pinch zooming which makes it really tough to click the small font web links with a finger.I have to thank my fiance Claire for putting up with seeing the device in my hands everytime she looked at me.  She seems to have more paitience than I do when it comes to that.This post was written using the Nokia N900 and MaStory.  I do have a few suggestions for MaStory.  It would be nice if there were some auto spell checking and support for the more tag which word press uses.  I had to come back in and edit this post from my iPad!!!
