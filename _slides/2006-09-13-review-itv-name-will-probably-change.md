title: "Review: iTV (name will probably change)"
---

Apple announced yesterday that they were going to be releasing a new product during the 1st Q of 2007.Â  They called this new item the iTV.Â  It is a piece of hardware that you can connect to your TV/Home Theater system and wirelessly stream music or video to your living room / den / bedroom.Â  They announce the initial price for the hardware to be $299.00.Â  The only drawback that i can see about the item is that they do not offer RCA or S-Video they only seem to offer HDMI / Composite.

This new hardware brings a question to the table.Â  Can you run multiple iTV's in your home to communicate with your computer.Â  I think it would be great to have one of these in the living room and one in the bedroom.Â  The use of multiple would keep me from having to move the iTV from room to room.

The new iTV will also feature a powercord that will not contain a power brick.Â  You will simply plug it directly into the wall.Â  I love this feature as having the power bricks are always a pain in the rear.Â  I look forward to getting one of these when they are released and i will furthur review the item.Â  This would solve many issues in my life and cannot wait ;)

Another feature that i really like about the iTV, since it communicates with your computer via 802.11 wireless networking it can access the apple website via the internet.Â  You can browse trailers online that will be streamed directly over the internet right to your TV.Â  I am sure that they will furthur enhance this ability so that you can access the iTMS store and buy movies, music, tv shows, etc right from your couch.Â  I cannot wait to see how the system works once it is released.Â  If it works as they say i have a feeling this will be a hit and many many people will just HAVE to have one ;)
