title: "Review: Qdoba Mexican Grill"
---

![Qdoba: Mexican Grill](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-1.png "Qdoba: Mexican Grill")This week I am down in Timonium, MD for work.  I thought I would take a few minutes to review a restaurant that is close to work.  On a lunch break you cannot get very far without a car so it is really convenient to have this almost next door.

During my first visit the guys brought me over to [Qdoba](http://www.qdoba.com/) for lunch.  I was hungry and usually a burrito is small so I ordered one chicken and one steak.  That was a mistake.  The burritos at [Qdoba](http://www.qdoba.com/) are pretty large and one would fill up just about anyone.  My favorite item there would have to be the chicken burrito, but I have also tried the Mexican Gumbo which is really good.

If you are in the area of one of these restaurant's I would highly suggest that you stop in for a meal.  The food is great but the service was just as good.  I was actually surprised at how good the service was for a restaurant like this.
