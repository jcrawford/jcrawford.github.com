![Liarcard Logo](http://josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-4.jpg)A while back I heard about a site called liarcard.com, this site stated that they had voice analysis software that was initially developed for security purposes.  It is now available to the public and they state that they are over 95% accurate.  I decided to try out this service tonight with my girlfriend.  We were asking all sorts of questions and answering them differently each time.  I have to say that this has to be a total waste of money.  When I was asking questions I asked what her favorite color was.  She answered with pink and it said she was honest.  Later in the conversation I asked the question again and she said orange…  Guess what?  She was truthful again.  At once point during the conversation I asked what time it was, she stated the correct time and it buzzed saying that she was lying.

It seemed very random as to the results.  After the 2 test calls that were placed I would have to suggest that you save your $10 and go get some lunch with it.  I would see this as being a fun tool to use when you have some time and money to burn but I do not see it as something you should be using to really find out answers.  The first thing I thought about when I originally heard of this service was that it would be great for using while doing over the phone job interviews.  However after this I would not suggest you use it for that at all.  The screen you see to the left is a graph of the dishonesty and stress levels.  Keep in mind the same questions were asked and had the opposite results.  If you find it hard to read the image you can click on it to see a larger version. The system even tracks more than just the stress and dishonesty levels though.

While all of these graphs and stats might seem cool at first glance I am not quite sure how they can say that they are over 95% accurate.  It was funny when the correct time was stated and it buzzed as if it were a blatant lie.  Please also note that we were not just asking random stupid questions.  We actually asked some pretty serious questions just to see what the answers would be and how accurate the system really was.  I would have to say that after these tests the system was just sub-par and not something you should take much stake in.  All I can really say is that I really feel bad for those who had this system used on them for security purposes and were found to be dishonest when they really were not.  I would never implement this in any type of security situation after seeing these results.  Have you tested this service?  What were your results?
