title: "Review: VPC Running Windows on a PPC Mac"
---

Whether or not you are willing to admit it most of us have the occasional Windows application that they like to run.  On a Power PC Mac you cannot install windows natively like you can on the new Intel based machines.  Yesterday I found out that it is possible to run windows on a PPC Mac.  You just have to install Virtual PC (a Microsoft product) which is an emulator that emulates a P2 and allows you to run Windows as a Virtual OS.

If you do any web design work for the web it is crucial that you be able to view how a site will look in Internet Explorer as well as browsers on the Mac such as Safari, FireFox, Flock, Camino, etc.  You could use BrowserShots ([www.browsershots.org](http://www.browsershots.org/)) but that takes time.  It can take anywhere from 1 minute to 4 hours for a screen shot to be captured with BrowserShots so you can see the issue there.

Today I installed Windows XP Professional on my Virtual PC and I also installed the additional tools so that my mouse could interact with both Windows and OS X without having to command-tab to get out of Virtual PC.  I have a dual display setup now so I have VPC on my secondary display running in full screen.  Itâ€™s pretty cool to have OS X on one screen and Windows XP on the other.

In order to use Windows I move my mouse over to the secondary display and I have access to everything.  This is really an excellent alternative to purchasing a new Intel based machine.  If you do any gaming however, I am sure it will not be sufficient.  It will more than likely be very slow.  I have noticed some lag on VPC when you open a large program or go into system settings, etc.

While used as a general tool (browser, IRC, etc.) I would give VPC an A+, for gamingâ€¦ well try gaming on a P2 with 512mb ram and you tell me.  I have thought about upgrading this Quad G5 to the new Mac Pro but I cannot justify the $1000 expense and I would get a machine with slower specs than this one.  The combination of VPC and my PPC machine works for my situation.  I just wish someone could emulate faster than a P2.
