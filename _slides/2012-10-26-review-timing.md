title: "Review: Timing"
---
A few weeks ago I started a new position with Acronym Media.  It has been a while since I have worked remotely so I wanted to make sure that I remain on task during work hours and get distracted as little as possible.  I started looking for productivity apps which could track what applications I am using and what percentage of my time is going to Work and Play.I started trying out a few applications until I found the one that I liked the most.  Enter [Timing](http://timingapp.com/ "Timing") a nice application which can track your activity as you work on your mac.  The first thing I want to state is that Timing is not free, they offer a demo on their website unlike a lot of applications these days so you can try it before you drop the $3.99 on the application.<!--more-->Now out of the box Timing comes with a few default categories and will start tracking your activity.  To know just how much time I am spending on Work vs Play I created a Work Activity by clicking the + sign in the lower left of the application window.  I then went to the Uncategorized Activity and started dragging work related activities to my work activity.  Once you assign something to an activity it will remain assigned to that activity so as you use it over time it will calculate just how much time you have spend doing that activity.I put the obvious applications such as Zend Studio, Skype, Terminal, etc into my work activity as these are essential tools I use for work every-day.  However you will also notice that Chrome is listed under my work activity.  This is because I had assigned certain sub-activities to the Work activity.  With some apps Timing has the ability to track file paths and website domains.  Since I access JIRA only for work I went to the Uncategorized activity and expanded Chrome to see the sub-activities.  I then dragged only the domains which were work related to the work activity.  This is great because I can add a domain to an activity and from this time forward it will track it under that activity.[![](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-1-300x261.png "Screen 1")](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Screen-1.png)If you take a look at the screen shot to the left you can see all of the applications which I have assigned.  You can also see all of the activities that I have created, some are the defaults that came with Timing.  You might look at that and say wait what?  How is VLC considered to be work?  Well I have had to watch some videos on learning GIT which is work related so I expanded the application and assigned those videos to the work activity.  Now anytime I watch these videos it will be tracked against my work activity.You will also notice that in the upper left of the user interface you can change the date filter to check out any date range you wish.  In the right upper side of the UI you will see a timeline graph outlining the time spent on the selected activity over time.  This is a nice line graph and it will change as you change the date range.  However while this graph is nice you can also click the By Project button in the upper right of the user interface and it will switch to a bar chart.  This is not very helpful when you are viewing a single activity but it is very valuable when you select All Activities.  It will show a nice bar graph showing you where the majority of your time is spent.The one thing I love about Timing is that it runs in the background so it's not in your way.  It has a menubar item which you can use to open the actual user interface and when you are done you can close the user interface and the application will continue to run tracking your activities.  I absolutely love an app that stays out of your way and does not effect your work flow.The last thing I would like to mention is that Timing also has a Blacklist activity by default.  You can add any application to the Blacklist and Timing will never track the time you spend in that application.  Timing also has a preference setting that will allow you to setup an idle time.  You specify this value in seconds and once your computer is idle for this amount of time Timing will stop tracking activity.  This is great however you might find that you have to increase the default time if you have a large screen and spend any time reading books.  I have found that the default of 150 seconds is not enough time to read a page in a book on a 30" screen.  Since the screen just reamins still until I need to scroll to the next page it can cause some tracking problems, therefore I have set my timeout to be 180 seconds.There are a few things that I think Timing could do to improve the application.    - Preferences in Menubar
To save the end-user even more time I would suggest they add an entry to the menubar menu for Preferences.  Currently I have to click the menubar item click Show Tracking Information and then enter preferences as you would in any other application.  I do not think I should have to open the user interface to get to the application preferences.    - Track Idle Time
Currently I do not see a way to tell Timer to track the time in which your computer is idle.  I think it would be nice to know just how often my computer is idle because that means I have walked away.  It would be nice to not only see how often but also how long it was idle each time.   - Graph Reporting
I noticed that when I have certain browser domains associated with other activity projects and the total time is calculated as both browsing and the other activity.  I wish it would not count domains that are assigned to another activity.  It would allow me to see the times better.  Currently it looks like I was browsing the web for 1.5 hours today when 1 hour of that was work related domains.While I have not been running Timing for that long yet I have really enjoyed seeing where the majority of my time is spent and just how often I get distracted.  This is a tool that I have added to my utility belt and it will not be removed anytime soon unless I find an application which does a better job than Timing.Have you used any of these applications?  Please let me know if you have and what you think the benefits are.
