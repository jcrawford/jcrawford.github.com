<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text">          I just love how you can move the windows around really fast and make them jiggle like JELLO.  As soon as I saw this I looked into the possibility of installing this side by side with OS X.  I asked in a few IRC channels and people decided that they needed to be sarcastic and tell me sure you can, you just have to put the monitors next to each other. I finally figured out that it will install without any issues on a Mac, you just need to use a boot loader.  My choice is rEFIt which I used in the past when I did a dual boot windows setup.  I attempted to install Ubuntu using the CD ISO that I downloaded.  It would not work for me.  Not because I have a fancy Mac Pro but it is the fact that I decided to go all fancy with my mouse and keyboard.  I have the Apple wireless keyboard and mouse which both run on blue tooth.  This evening I will have to go pick up a cheap wired keyboard and mouse just to get through the installer.
