<p>With the music from this video and the way the main guy moves all you can think about is this is lame.  I am not sure if this is real or not and the idea that this video was edited was sure to hit my mind.  Although I doubt it is real it was entertaining to watch.  If this is real I give props to those who made this.  The part that I question being real is the scene with the car.  Oh so now you are wondering and just have to watch the video to find out what I am talking about.<embed allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="235" width="325" src="http://www.dailymotion.com/swf/5PmHTbn1kfWtjdcR8"></embed></p>
