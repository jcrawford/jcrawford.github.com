<p>I know at some point everyone has had the dreaded telephone ear.  It&#39;s when you are on the phone for so long your ear starts to hurt.  That happened to me today.  I was on the phone for a whopping 3 hours and 35 minutes.  When I got off the phone my ear was lost without the phone.    </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I have talked this much on the phone for about 7 years.  Anyway it&#39;s time to let the ear get some rest ;)   </p>
