<p>It was not that long ago that everyone was running around trying to figure out how to customize the Leopard dock.  Well the good guys over at Panic have released <a href="http://www.panic.com/candybar/">Candybar 3</a> which is for Leopard only.  It will allow you to change your dock, along with a ton of other icons such as hard drives, trash, etc.</p>

<p>There are also many free Candybar iContainers over at <a href="http://iconfactory.com/freeware/icon">Icon Factory</a>.  Although I do personally think Candybar Wrappers would have been a better name for them ;)  </p>
