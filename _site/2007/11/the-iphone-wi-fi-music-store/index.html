<p>I am personally not an iPhone owner yet, however I received an e-mail from AT&amp;T just now that told me the iTunes Wi-Fi store is now open on the iPhone.  You can go to any hot spot and are now able to buy your music from the iTunes store directly from your iPhone.  This is really cool, I wonder if it includes the purchase of movies and TV shows, one would hope.</p>

<p>THe only thing this leaves me to wonder is if this will work with an unlocked iPhone.  My guess is that Apple has done something to make this only work with locked phones, but then again maybe they didn&#39;t.  If anyone reading this has an unlocked iPhone please leave some comments as to whether or not this will work with the unlocked phones.</p>
