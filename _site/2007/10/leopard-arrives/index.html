<p>So I was finally able to install the new Leopard and I must say that so far I am loving it.  Now is it worth the big fuss Apple put up about it?  Probably not to the average user.  I know this is not the first review of leopard as I was not inclined to test out the beta&#39;s however I know it won&#39;t be the last either.  Right now I have TimeMachine doing the initial backup and contrary to what everyone says you do not need an external drive to work with it.  I have a spare internal drive that I set as the backup drive and it is working just fine.  They have updated the dock to allow for stacks which are nice if you need to get at something quickly.</p>

<p>Overall I have to say that I do not regret upgrading however there are a few apps that I use that I had to do some digging to get them to work.  Visor a well known terminal application (which is just a SIMBL plug-in really) would not work with the Terminal.app that comes with Leopard.  The work around was to keep a copy of the 10.4 Terminal.app and use that.  I finally got that working and love the fact that I have it.  Spending so much time in terminal it&#39;s nice to have something like this.</p>

<p>Menufela is another app that I use.  This just hides the menu-bar at the top of the screen.  People have argued that there is no point in doing this but I find that it helps me with a bit more screen real estate and also saves my display from Image Persistence.  I do not yet see a work around for this but I will be on the lookout.</p>

<p>Spaces seems nice but then again nothing beats a dual display setup sorry guys ;)</p>

<p>One thing that I am amazed with is the fact that I ordered it yesterday and even though FedEx said 5 days delivery it was here at 8:30 this morning.  Talk about a fast transaction.</p>
