<p><img src="http://tinyurl.com/2539rf" alt="">I was reading a post today on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ynveow">formykountry</a> that gives you the choice of <a href="http://formykountry.com/?p=88">sex or ice cream</a>.  You are stranded on a tropical island with all the food/shelter etc. that you need.  Every afternoon you get the choice of a companion of the opposite sex for 30 minutes or you can have ice cream.  They talk about what a 19 year old with rocks in their pants will choose vs someone who knows what sex is all about.  My solution to the issue of not being able to have both...  One day choose the ice cream, save it somehow (even though it will melt), the next day have a little fun with the saved melted ice cream ;)  </p>
