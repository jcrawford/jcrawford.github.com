<p>Tonight I went to Jingle Jam 2007 with my younger cousin Matt.  It was a blast, among those playing were <a href="http://www.mattwhitemusic.com/">Matt White</a>, <a href="http://www.inine.com/">INine</a>, <a href="http://www.boyslikegirls.com/">Boys Like Girls</a>.  Although I really do not like the one hit song that BLG has called Hero/Heroine I did enjoy the show that they put on.  My favorite of the night though has to be INine.  They were rocking the place and have some really good songs.  The one you will most likely know is Seven Days of Lonely.  I tried to embed the YouTube video on here however for some reason they have disabled the ability to embed the video into your own website.</p>

<p>INine is from the South Carolina area so if you are down that way (or hear of them playing in your area) definately go check them out.  They were great with the fans also, unlike Girls Like Boys you did not have to buy there merchandise to get something signed.  Although I bought a shirt not everyone there could afford to buy the merchandise.  Below are pictures of what I had signed at the show. If you like the song, visit their website for more information on the band, you can also buy their single (Seven Days of Lonely) on the <a href="itms://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?i=26216225&amp;id=262162223&amp;s=143441&amp;partnerid=30&amp;partnerid=30&amp;siteID=W3RIIdWcIOU-beJY_SJHLbF_Qzi3aMZg6w&amp;ign-mscache=1" title="INine Single">iTunes store</a>.  When they got on stage I was not sure what to expect. I had heard their single however I did not know what was to come from all of the songs they have that were not yet  well known.  They did a kick-ass job rocking the stage and I look forward to seeing them play again.  Currently they only have a single for sale however they did mention that Arista Records had signed them and they would be releasing a CD sometime in 2008.  They did give a month I believe but I do not recall when exactly it is going to be.

I apologize if this post seems to be more about INine than the other bands however it just shows what band I enjoyed the most.  The concert was great but I was a bit surprised to see that they were allowing anyone in.  If you were under 16 you had to have your parent or legal guardian with you.  Can you say that 90% of the crows were 12-16 year old kids.  I am not surprised that Boys Like Girls attracts that age group but the venue was Northern Lights which is a bar.  </p>

<p><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/photo-3.jpg" alt="GLB Signed Shirt">At the beginning of the night my cousin and I made our way towards the front of the crowd so that we could get a good view of the bands on stage.  I found however that being in a cramped area with a ton of young kids bumping into you and rubbing up on you was very uncomfortable.  It was also a sure way to spill a beer.  We ended up spending the rest of the night back towards the bar and to our surprise the view was better than being up close. </p>

<p>Overall it was a great night out where I got to meet new people and enjoy live music.  What more could I ask for?  Oh wait... Why didn&#39;t INine play longer, why were they NOT the feature band?  I cannot wait to go see them when they are the featured band.  Mark my words it won&#39;t be long before that is happening.  They are already making a name for themselves, they will be on MTV&#39;s TRL tomorrow I think it was so be sure to check that out as well.  Before I end this post I also want to mention that you should check out the <a href="http://www.inine.com/">INine website</a> and if you like their stuff add them as a friend from their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/inine">MySpace profile</a>.</p>

<p>I also just want to take a minute and thank the bands for playing tonight, I know it&#39;s a gig and money to you but I really enjoyed the show  and INine I enjoyed talking with you guys a bit at the merchandise table.</p>
