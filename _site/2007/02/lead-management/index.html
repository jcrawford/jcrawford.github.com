<p>When it comes down to running an on-line business of any type you need some way to manage your leads.  I run a website development company and I have been finding it harder and harder to keep track of my leads.  After all I am just 1 guy with about 50 clients and leads coming in every day.I have looked into companies like <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">SalesForce</a> however they are just too expensive for me.  The smallest account they offer is $65 per user per month.  Although it is a rather nice system and is very nice to look at as a small business owner I could not afford that.  Tonight I ran across another company that offers a <a href="http://www.aimpromote.com/features/">lead management</a> solution.  <a href="http://www.aimpromote.com/">AIMpromote</a> does not have the fancy, sexy user interface that Sales Force has, however they have quite a log of features so they are comparable with Sales Force.AIMpromote offers their accounts for $33 per user per month, which I still find a bit steep since it is just me however it might be something I am forced to look into.  Losing leads could cost me more than the $33 per month.  The nice part about AIMpromote is that they offer a 14-day FREE trial.  I have yet to take advantage of that but I am going to sign-up first thing Monday morning.  Once I have signed up I will be able to really sink my teeth into all of the features and see how much it will actually help my company.  I know I need <em>SOMETHING</em>.The only thing I think they need to improve on is the user interface.  A softer look and feel would be great.</p>
