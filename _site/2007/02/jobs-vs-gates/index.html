<p>Today I was browsing around YouTube and I came across this video.  I will warn you it has some strong language and sexual reference.  If you are offended by that do not watch this video.  I personally found this to be very humerus and enjoyable.[youtube=<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHO8l-Bd1O4%5DI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHO8l-Bd1O4]I</a> espacially like the Finder song and the ending apologies lol, what do you think?Â  The author of this video is very talented and I would love to see more of their work.</p>
