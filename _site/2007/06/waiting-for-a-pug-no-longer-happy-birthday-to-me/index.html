I think they are cute with all of the wrinkles that they have.  They are a nice lap dog that will be a great companion.  My girlfriend was planning on getting me one for my birthday but wanted to tell me so that I could pick it out.  My girlfriend and I were looking at the different pups that were available on-line.  We found one with really good champion bloodlines and quickly put down a deposit.  I have yet to come up with a name for the pup, it is a female so suggestions are welcome.What you see is a picture of the pup which the breeder calls &quot;Jade&quot;.  She is about 4 months old now and how cute she is.  We decided that if we were going to get a pug that we might as well get a good quality one that we could potentially show or breed in the future.  This pup is gorgeous and I would have no issues with showing it.  As you can see from the picture we are getting the pup from <a href="http://www.trinitykennel.com/" title="Trinity Kennel">Trinity Kennel</a>, so far it has been a great transaction and I will update all of you with how great it was once it is completed.</p>
