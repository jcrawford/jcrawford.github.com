<p>I was checking out The News Room a bit more to see what they had for technology news and I thought this was really cool.  They have created a single seat car that can operate at slow speeds for around the house (you would have to be really lazy lol) and at faster speeds for on the road.  The vehicle looks really sweet.  I wonder what the price point will be when they actually come to market.  I couldn&#39;t see them being any more expensive than a road bike but you never know.  Bleeding edge technology is always more.I could see myself cruising around town in one of these.  I wonder what the insurance rates will be for these things hehe.  One thing they don&#39;t touch on in the news video is how fast it will actually go.  It&#39;s a gas and electric hybrid.  I would guess that it could reach speeds of 60 mph so that you would not be holding up traffic on the highways haha.  I would so pimp this out with sub-woofers and go cruising.What do you think about the future of transportation?  Coming from Toyota it HAS to be good.  Their cars and trucks are known to be the best at lasting forever.  The bodies fall apart but the engine doesn&#39;t die.&lt;!--more--&gt;<object height="200" id="swfclipf420" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="200"></object><param value="always" name="allowScriptAccess" /><param value="http://www.thenewsroom.com/mash/swf/cube.swf?a=f420&amp;m=19697&amp;v=1" name="movie" /><param value="." name="base" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="200" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" name="swfclipf420" width="200" src="http://www.thenewsroom.com/mash/swf/cube.swf?a=f420&amp;m=19697&amp;v=1" allowscriptaccess="always" base="."></embed></p>
