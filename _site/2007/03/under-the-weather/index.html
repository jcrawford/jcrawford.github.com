<p>Over the last few days I have been sick as a dog.Â  I have been congested, short of breath and even sick to my stomach.Â  I went to the doctors yesterday and they said that I have a sinus infection and a double ear infection.Â  I hope I get better soon it just sucks being sick.Although I have been sick I have been pushing through it trying to get as much work done as I can.Â  I have been making some good progress with the Google Maps API and hope to start that article at some point so keep your eyes open.</p>
