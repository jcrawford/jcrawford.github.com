<p>Tonight I was working on the <a href="http://www.browserreports.com/">BrowserReports</a> site and altered the spy feature that we had.  Now you can spy on your own domains referals.  An example would be <a href="http://www.browserreports.com/spy/josephcrawford.com/10">this page</a>.Also notice on the sidebar of this site I am showing the last 10 referers.  Keep watching it, it will reload automatically using AJAX to get the referers from <a href="http://www.browserreports.com/">BrowserReports</a>.:: EDIT ::I just noticed that the sidebar is not working on IE 7 in Windows Vista.  I will be diagnosing this soon and getting that fixed.  Sorry to all of those who are using it.Ok so I figured out what the issue was.  IE is what is stopping it, go to Tools -&gt; Internet Options -&gt; Security -&gt; Custom Level and check the box next to &quot;Access data sources across domains&quot; This should fix the issue.</p>
