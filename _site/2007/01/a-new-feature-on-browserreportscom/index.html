<p>Tonight BrowserReports.Com has launched a new feature.Â  It&#39;s actually pretty cool and is dubbed &quot;spy&quot; and for good reason.Â  It allows you to spy on the referrals as they are coming into the site.Â  Now it is not exactly &quot;real time&quot; because if we had it running every second it would be too intensive on the server.Â  It is running every 5 seconds with an auto reload using AJAX and JSON to deliver the data.You can take a look and watch the referrals come in, just head over to the <a href="http://www.browserreports.com/spy" title="BrowserReports.COm Spy Page">spy page</a>.</p>
