<p>About 6 months ago I made the switch to the Mac platform.Â  The one thing that really bothered me was how the Mac handled the Home and End keys.Â  They did not seem to work as expected coming from a Windows platform.Â  I had tried searching for a solution and even asked some OS X guru&#39;s on IRC.Â  However I was unable to come up with anything.Today on the NY PHP Mailing List there was a thread about the Mac and how they should setup the development environment.Â  This seemed to quickly go way off topic and start talking about the must have apps for the Mac.Â  Rob Marscher from <a href="http://beaffinitive.com/" title="Affinitive LLC">Affinitive LLC</a> piped in and started telling us how he works with Linux machines at work and then has Mac&#39;s at home.Â  He had always hated the way the Home and End keys have functioned as well.Â Â  Rob posted <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/keyboard/mac-switchers-tip--remap-the-home-and-end-keys-225873.php">this link</a> that shows how to re-map your Home and End keys to work as they do on a Windows machine.On the page I started to read the comments and I found the application called <a href="http://doublecommand.sourceforge.net/" title="DoubleCommand">DoubleCommand</a>.Â  This is a very easy to install preference pane that allows you to customize quite a bit more than just the Home and End keys.Â  You can also save the settings for the System or only the current user.DoubleCommand is another MUST HAVE utility for anyone coming to the Mac platform from the Windows environment.</p>
