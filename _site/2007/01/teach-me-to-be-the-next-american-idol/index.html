<p>I am not sure if you are keeping up with American Idol or not but some of the people they are getting this year are the worst I have ever seen on the show.Â  Last night the final person from NYC knew they could not sing at all and knew that they were tone deaf.Â  She decided to go to the show because people would make fun of her when she would sing.At the end she was pretty much begging for the judges to take her on and &quot;teach&quot; her everything she needed to know so that she could be the next American Idol....Â  _WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?Â  _Did she seriously think they would say sure we can do that...There was one girl however who could sing but the judges would not give her a chance.Â  She was previously on the show and went to Hollywood and was cut.Â  She has taken all of the judges criticism to heart and tried to improve on everything they have told her in the past.Â  I am not sure why they would not give her another chance, she was good.Â  I am not saying she would go all the way because there is not a doubt in my mind that she would be cut before the final show.Â  She was trying so hard during the audition and begging for them to give her another shot, although she failed at getting another shot I think she will go far with her career.Now the judges would not give the girl who was cut another chance, but the guy who willingly quit last year came in and got another chance.Â  Yes he does have a great voice, but why would they give him another chance when he gave up and not give the girl who was really trying another chance?</p>
