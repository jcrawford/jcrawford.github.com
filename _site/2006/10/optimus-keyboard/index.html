<p>I just heard about the optimus keyboard and after seeing the images on the site I cannot wait for the full size keyboard to become available.  It is very cool, they keys will actually light up with the current action that will be taken if you hit that key.You can see more at <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/maximus/" title="Optimus Keyboard">the website</a>.The Optimus &quot;mini three&quot; is already on sale and the &quot;Upravlator&quot; is&quot;coming soon,&quot; and the fullsized Optimus keyboard is also coming soon.Currently they do not have mac drivers but they are working on it and have even posted screenshots of a test on a mac.Check out the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/optimus_project/" title="Optimus Keyboard Development Blog">development blog</a>.</p>
