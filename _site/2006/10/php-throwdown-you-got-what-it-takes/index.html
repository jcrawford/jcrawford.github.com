<p>So there is a new contest that is in the planning and development stages.  It’s called <a href="http://www.phpthrowdown.com" title="PHP Throwdown">PHP Throwdown</a>, it is a 24 hour coding contest.  You can compete either as an individual or a team.  The goal is to complete the best application within the 24 hour time period.</p>

<p>Do you think you have what it takes?  I can almost guarantee that the competitors in this contest will only get a few hours sleep (if any) so it will take quite a bit if you plan to take part.</p>

<p>There will be 4 categories for applications which you can compete in, however they are still to be determined.  They also have not disclosed any of the prizes which you will be competing for.  I am sure that will come soon.</p>

<p>I have yet to determine if I will take part in this contenst, I will need to wait and see what the categories are and if I can come up with ideas of what to do.  However if I do take part i would want a designer to work with me to make it look good so drop me a line if you would be interested.  I would also have to see what the prizes are.</p>

<p>So when will this contest take place?  January 27th 2007 so mark your calendars!</p>

<p>If you have any ideas on what the categories should be, feel free to drop by <a href="http://www.phpthrowdown.com/" title="PHP Throwdown">the site</a> and contact contest admin. </p>
