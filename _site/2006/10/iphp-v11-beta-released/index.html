<p>I apologize to all those who downloaded iPHP v1.0 beta, there were a few issues keeping users from easilly installing the module.Â  These issues have been fixed.I have also made it so that the url&#39;s used in iPHP now use <a href="http://www.php.net">www.php.net</a> so that the appropriate mirror is choosen for the user.</p>

<p>You can download iPHP on my <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/php-irc-modules/iphp/" title="iPHP v1.1 beta">iPHP module page</a>. </p>
