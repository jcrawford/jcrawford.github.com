<p>If you are in need of a PHP Developer / Website Design, feel free to contact me if you run an online store.  We can always barter if your cash flow is low.  I have been willing to in the past and I am willing to now.  Ofcourse the product has to be of interest, if you try to trade dog food it just won&#39;t work ;)</p>

<p>As always the first time we deal with eachother the code will be completed first and put live on my servers.  Once approved by you i will push it to your servers in exchange for the products we bartered for.</p>

<p>You may be asking yourself is this guy serious?  Yes very.  I have a day job which pays the bills, etc.  If i can barter for products / services that I would normally use, why not?  It saves me from having to buy them with my paycheck.</p>

<p>Maybe you are saying, he probably just jacks the rates up even higher than normal just to get more for his time.  You are incorrect if that is how you are thinking.  I actually lower my rates a bit because I feel more people should be bartering (and i dont have to pay taxes when we barter).  Ofcourse each side has to get something they deem valuable for what they are trading ;)</p>

<p>Currently i am interested in Apple products, however dont be afraid to contact me if you do not have any Apple products, there is more to life than Apple.  Did I just say that? </p>

<p>Contacting me will cost nothing, why not atleast talk about it?  Fill out <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/contact-me/" title="Contact Form">this simple form</a> and i will get back to you.</p>
