<p>I am happy to announce that I have hit the first milestone for this site, i never thought it would be after the second month of being live.  My goal withing the first 4 months was to get 1000 visitors here in a month.  In August we had about 500 readers, and in September we jumped to just over 1000.  I want to thank all of you who read this site and look forward to making this site even better over time.  I hope that the content i provide will be enough to occupy your free time ;) </p>
