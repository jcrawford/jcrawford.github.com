<p>I know this may seem morbid and cruel to some of you but i do not mean it to be that way.  Everyone is talking and throwing a fuss about how the crocodile hunter has passed away due to a tragic accident with a stingray.  I think everyone knew this day would come...  You cannot just mess with the really dangerous wildlife and expect to not get bit or lose your life one day.  Did he ever deal with Alligators or just Crocodiles?</p>

<p>Even FedEx predicted it would one day happen and i am sute that Steve had the notion that one day something could happen.  Look at this video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>I do pass on respect to Steve&#39;s family and wish them the best while recovering from this loss. </p>
