<p>Amazon launched its own video download service on Thursday called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox">Unbox</a>.  They are offering you 1 free TV Show download ($1.99 value) so that you will try thier service.  I quickly ran over to download a TV Show only to find that in order to download a show you need to use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/help/install-client.html/103-0237886-4912656" title="Unbox Video Player">Unbox Video Player</a>.  I half expected this, however what i did not expect is a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> <em><strong>ONLY</strong></em> software.  I figured someone as big as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" title="Amazon">Amazon</a> would have a cross platform application that would run on <em><strong>ANY</strong></em> operating system.  I was wrong, so i turned on my computer that is running <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx" title="Windows Vista">Vista Pre-RC1</a>, downloaded the installtion files and started the process.  Wow wouldn&#39;t you know it the application will not install.  It requires <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx" title="Windows XP">XP SP 2</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx" title="Windows 2003">Windows 2003</a>.  Already i am not a fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox/" title="Amazon Unbox Video Service">Unbox</a>, although i have not been able to test the quality of the video&#39;s they are claiming them to be DVD quality.  Every purchase also comes with 2 files, one for you to watch on the computer/tv and the other for portable devices.  I am guessing they mean <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx" title="Microsoft Windows">Windows</a> based portable devices so all of you iPod owners are out of luck.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox/" title="Unbox Video Service">Unbox</a> will offer both TV Shows and Movies for sale.  You can buy a movie for $7.99-$14.99 and TV Shows are $1.99.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox/" title="Unbox Video Service">Unbox</a> is taking it one step furthur and offering rentals.  You can pay $3.99 for a rental which will disable itself 24 hours after you watch it.  I think this is a good idea since $3.99 is the typical rental price and the costs for making the DVD packaging would offset the cost of the movies here.</p>

<p>I really do hope <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a> starts the Movie service everyone is talking about, and i hope that they are cross platform so that everyone can enjoy the service that <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a> will provide.  I cannot express enough how unimpressed i am with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" title="Amazon">Amazon</a> today.</p>
