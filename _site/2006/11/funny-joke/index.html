<p>I was going through my E-Mail today and I read the following joke.&gt; I have never understood why the sexual urge of men and women differ so  much...   FOR EXAMPLE: One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.  The passion starts to heat up, when she eventually said &quot;I don&#39;t feel  like it, I just want you to hold me.&quot;   I said &quot;WHAT ? What was that?!&quot;   So she says the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...  &quot;You&#39;re just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for  me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.&quot; She then responded to my  puzzled look by saying, &quot;Can&#39;t you just love me for who I am and not  for what I do in the bedroom?&quot;Realizing that nothing was going to  happen that night, I went to sleep...   The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time  with her.  We went out to a good lunch and then went shopping at a  very big department store. I walked around with her while she tried on  several different very expensive outfits. She couldn&#39;t decide which  one to take so I told her we&#39;d just buy them all.  She wanted new  shoes to complement her new clothes, so I said &quot;Let&#39;s get a pair for  each outfit&quot;.   We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of  diamond earrings. Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have  thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.  I started to think she  was testing me because she then asked for a tennis bracelet when she  doesn&#39;t even know how to play tennis.I think I threw her when I said, &quot;That&#39;s fine, honey.&quot; She was almost  nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.  Smiling with  excited anticipation she finally said, &quot;I think this is all dear,  let&#39;s go to the cashier.&quot;   I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, &quot;No honey, I don&#39;t  feel like it.&quot; Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped  with a baffled &quot;WHAT?&quot; I then said &quot;Honey! I just want you to HOLD  this stuff for a while. You&#39;re just not in touch with my financial  needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.  &quot; And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I  added, &quot;Why can&#39;t you just love me for who I am and not for the things  I buy you?&quot;   Apparently I&#39;m not having sex tonight either.This is just too much, I was laughing so hard I almost woke up my girlfriend.</p>
