<p>I was finally able to get my comments to accept the paging capability of a plugin that I found.  I put the <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/" title="Gravatar">gravatar.com</a> code back in place after limiting the comments to 10 per page.  It seems Gravatar is still having some issues.  The pages would load slow and that is not something I want to have happen on my site.  I have once again disabled the gravatar code until they fix the issues they are having.  I am looking forward to Gravatar 2.0 and hope they get the issues fixed soon. </p>
