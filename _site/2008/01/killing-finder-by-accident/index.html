<p>Tonight I realized something, it caught me off guard for a second.  Generally to quit a program I will hit command-q to quit the program.  Tonight I wanted to close a Finder window so I hit command-q and to my surprise this actually killed the entire Finder process and not only the front most Finder window.  Now that I think about this it is the proper behavior but I would think that with something as critical as Finder they would make that command only close the front most window.  I noticed that everything was gone, even the icons on my desktop.  I guess this is a quicker way than dropping to terminal to sudo killall Finder. </p>
