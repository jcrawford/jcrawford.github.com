<p>While I was looking into the TomTom POI&#39;s I started to wonder about incorporating Google Maps into a Cocoa Application that could handle creating custom POI sets for my device.  Well it led me on a small detour but I figured out how to incorporate Google Maps into a Cocoa Application and explain how in my article titled <a href="http://josephcrawford.com/macdev-articles/google-maps-in-a-cocoa-application/">Google Maps in a Cocoa Application</a>.  While I cannot say that I am an expert on Cocoa Development I have been learning a lot.  With that said you may find issues with my code, I don&#39;t doubt that.  I just figured since I figured out how to do it I would share with everyone.</p>
