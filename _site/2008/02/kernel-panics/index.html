<p>Over the last few days I have had several kernel panics on OS X 10.5.2.  The only thing that has changed since this all started happening was a new job.  I have been working from home using the Cisco client for the first few days and all was going well.  I found it tedious to continuously enter my password into the Cisco client and it was recommended that I use a utility called <a href="http://www.nexumoja.org/projects/Shimo/" title="Shimo">Shimo</a> which is a more feature rich front end for the Cisco backend.</p>

<p>All of these kernel panics started happening shortly after I started to use Shimo, I am wondering if it could be the cause?  Have any of you readers had this issue?  It seems to only happen sometimes and not every time I connect or disconnect.  It even happens after I have been connected for a while.  I think I will have to discontinue use of Shimo and go back to the Cisco client.  If this solves the kernel panics I will be sure to let you know. </p>
