<p><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/picture-1.png" alt="Qdoba: Mexican Grill" title="Qdoba: Mexican Grill">This week I am down in Timonium, MD for work.  I thought I would take a few minutes to review a restaurant that is close to work.  On a lunch break you cannot get very far without a car so it is really convenient to have this almost next door.</p>

<p>During my first visit the guys brought me over to <a href="http://www.qdoba.com/">Qdoba</a> for lunch.  I was hungry and usually a burrito is small so I ordered one chicken and one steak.  That was a mistake.  The burritos at <a href="http://www.qdoba.com/">Qdoba</a> are pretty large and one would fill up just about anyone.  My favorite item there would have to be the chicken burrito, but I have also tried the Mexican Gumbo which is really good.</p>

<p>If you are in the area of one of these restaurant&#39;s I would highly suggest that you stop in for a meal.  The food is great but the service was just as good.  I was actually surprised at how good the service was for a restaurant like this.</p>
