<p>So while this does not seem to be <em>new</em> it was just e-mailed to me by my parents and I had never seen it.  It is an amazing piece of work..  Here is what the e-mail said about it.[blockquote align=&quot;left&quot; variation=&quot;green&quot;]This is almost unbelievable. See how all of the balls wind up in catcher cones. This incredible machine was built as a collaborative effort between the Robert M. Trammell Music Conservatory and the Sharon Wick School of Engineering at the University of Iowa. Amazingly, 97% of the machines &amp; gt; components came from John Deere Industries and Irrigation Equipment of Bancroft, Iowa, yes farm equipment! It took the team a combined 13,029 hours of set-up, alignment, calibration, and tuning before filming this video but as you can see it was WELL worth the effort. It is now on display in the Matthew Gerhard Alumni Hall at the University and is already slated to be donated to the Smithsonian.[/blockquote][youtube url=&quot;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uuA7fG58KI%22">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uuA7fG58KI&quot;</a>]</p>
