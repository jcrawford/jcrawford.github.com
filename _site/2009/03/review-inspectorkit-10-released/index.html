<p>The other day my friend <a href="http://www.degutis.org/">Steven</a> from <a href="http://www.thoughtfultree.com/">Thoughtful Tree Software</a> released a new version of his <a href="http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/">Inspector Framework</a>.  This new version includes both the framework and an Interface Builder Plug-in which makes it extremely easy for you to integrate this into your own projects.After reading his <a href="http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/">blog post</a> and watching the <a href="http://www.degutis.org/extra/InspectorKit.mov">video</a> that he has created it looks like a very nice addition to any application that would require an inspector style window.  I might have to look at using this in my project the TomTom POI Manager.  I am not yet sure what I would use this for but surely I can find a reason to use it.&lt;!--more--&gt;In the comments of <a href="http://www.degutis.org/">Stevens</a> <a href="http://www.degutis.org/dev/2009/02/26/inspector-panel-for-leopard/">prior post</a> about the <a href="http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/">InspectorKit</a> some people pointed out a <a href="http://www.degutis.org/dev/2009/02/26/inspector-panel-for-leopard/comment-page-1/#comment-6">few small things</a> that should be fixed.  One of the issues was how the mouse cursor did not change when you hover over a separator as it does in Interface Builder.  <a href="http://www.degutis.org/">Steven</a> has told me that he fixed this issue however this was more of an overhaul to get it into the plug-in format than anything.With <a href="http://www.degutis.org/">Stevens</a> <a href="http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/">InspectorKit</a> you can add an inspector panel to your application with extreme ease.  it is as simple as installing the Interface Builder Plug-in and dragging the elements into your window.  Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.degutis.org/extra/InspectorKit.mov">video</a> that <a href="http://www.degutis.org/">Steven</a> has created showing just how to use the <a href="http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/">InspectorKit</a>.
