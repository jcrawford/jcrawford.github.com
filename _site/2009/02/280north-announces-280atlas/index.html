<p>As most of you know I have been getting more and more into mac development in what free time I have (which is not much).  I have actually learned a lot about it with the help of some great guys in #macdev on irc.freenode.netI have been trying to keep up with what is happening in the <a href="http://www.cappuccino.org/">Cappuccino</a> world as well because while that is not technically mac development they are making it so that you can develop interactive web apps in much the same way you do Cocoa Applications.If you are not sure who 280 North is or what exactly Cappuccino is you can check them out at <a href="http://280north.com/">http://280north.com/</a>.When I first heard of Cappucino I was intrigued by the idea of creating a framework like Cocoa based on JavaScript.  I really wanted to see what they could do with it.  I was first amazed by the application that 280 North had written with it called <a href="http://280slides.com/">280Slides</a>.  This is a very impressive application to have been written completely with JavaScript.Yesterday 280 North revealed an application called <a href="http://280atlas.com/">280Atlas</a>.  I have to say this is another very well put together application and once again I cannot believe all of this can be done via JS.  Building applications like this is going to be very nice considering you can store data on the server but have all of the code for the application run on the client side in their browser window.  They are really making Cappuccino development very much like Mac Development using Interface Builder for the interface.  This is going to save developers a lot of time in the code.This really makes me want to learn JavaScript and front-end stuff has never intrigued me at all.</p>
