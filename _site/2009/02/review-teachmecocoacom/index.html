<p>My friend Steven just launched this site.  It is a site based on WordPress that will host video tutorials on how to use Cocoa called <a href="http://www.teachmecocoa.com/?referer=jcrawford">TeachMeCocoa.com</a>.  Currently it has just launched and only has one video <a href="http://www.teachmecocoa.com/video-tutorials/iphone-sdk/beginners-iphone-sdk/2009/02/27/files-and-collections/?referer=jcrawford">Files and Collections</a> which talks about different collection types and how to use them.  It also discusses how to save and read data to and from files.Steven is doing something great for the community by offering up these tutorials for free however he will accept donations.  He mentioned that he needs better equipment such as a nice headset that will cancel out the background noise as he has a few little one&#39;s running around.I have yet to watch the first video but I am going to do that now.  A BIG thank you goes out to Steven as I am in the process of learning and I AM SURE that these videos will be very helpful for me.  Watch your donation box Steven :)</p>
