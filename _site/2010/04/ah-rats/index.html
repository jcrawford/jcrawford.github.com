<p>Over the last week I have been trying to get rid of a rat that has made a home in our back yard.  The landlords had this wood platform that they had built with 2x4 and plywood for the garbage barrels in the back yard.  Last week Dylan came in and told me that he thought he saw one peering out from under the wood.  I went down and lifted the wood to find a big fat rat was sleeping under there during the day.  While I like animals I find these rats to be very nasty and who knows what diseases they carry.  The landlord said he was going to put broken glass under the platform to get rid of the rat.  I will not go into details on how I got it but take a look how big it was.  It&#39;s measuring up next to a 10.5 US shoe.  In Lynn MA there is surely no shortage on these things.  When I sit on the porch at night you will see them scurry across the street and on trash night you will see them jumping from barrel to barrel savaging for food.</p>
