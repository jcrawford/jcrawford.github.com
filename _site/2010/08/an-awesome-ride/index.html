<p>Over this weekend we had a few things to do.  We had to go to North Adams to pick-up Dylan from his Grandmothers as he spent most of the summer up there.  We also had to make our way to Springfield, VT to take a look at the bike we are might buy for Claire.  It&#39;s a 2010 Ninja 250r which would be a good starter bike for her and get her through 1-2 seasons after we change the sprockets, chain, throw on a slip on exhaust.  The bike was in almost perfect condition and when I took it for a ride it went through the gears nicely.&lt;!--more--&gt;<div align="center"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bike.jpg" alt="2010 Ninja 250r" title="2010 Ninja 250r"></div>Saturday morning we started the ride by heading over Route 2 (Mohawk Trail) to get to North Adams, MA.  We spent the day with my finance&#39;s family and stayed overnight in North Adams.  Sunday morning we woke up and took our time getting ready.  We ended up hitting the road around 11:45AM and hit Route 8 to Route 9 over Woodford mountain.  This was a very nice ride there were a lot of twisties, I just wish there were less cars on the road as they kept slowing down for all of the corners.  I enjoyed that ride a lot even the highway miles were enjoyable.  Once we hit Brattleboro VT we got on to I91 and headed north to Springfield.  We arrived at Springfield around 2PM and met the guy who was selling the motorcycle at the Holiday Inn Express which is right off the highway.  We looked over the bike and even took it for a ride around the parking lot to go through the gears and make sure it was in good mechanical condition.  When we left Springfield we found that it would be a shorter ride (as it was all highway) to head north to West Lebanon, NH and hit I89 to get home so we headed north and took that route.  I had to stop twice on the way home to stretch my legs as it was a long ride for being on a sport bike.  We arrived home around 6PM and headed to a friends to relax for a bit.
