<p>There have been many times where police officers have had to use appropriate force when dealing with criminals and there are times where they go overboard.  I was watching these videos on Youtube today and thought I should write up a post about situations like these.  In the first video you can see the guy on the motorcycle going at a high rate of speed and pulling a wheelie while passing a bus in the slow lane on I95 in Maryland.  There is no sound in the first video that actually shows everything and I am not quite sure why it was not included.  In the video you will notice that at 2:40 the bike takes an exit to the right and starts to slow down for the traffic ahead.  All of the sudden an unmarked car pulls ahead of him positioning itself to block the motorcycle.  A man hops out, pulls out a gun and says get off the motorcycle 3 times before finally saying that he was with the State Police.  I feel this is the only mistake the officer had made, his first words prior to pulling the gun out should have been Police don&#39;t move.  Everyone is scrutinizing the officer for pulling his service weapon however I kinda feel like he handled the situation properly.  Not once did he actually point the gun at the individual and once the rider heard it was the police he started to cooperate and the officer holstered the weapon.&lt;!--more--&gt;<div align="center"><object height="245" width="400"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/G7PC9cZEWCQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" name="movie" /><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" /><param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="245" class="floatcenter" width="400" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/G7PC9cZEWCQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></div>This second video is just a portion of the first video but includes the sound so that you can hear exactly what the officer is saying.  You will notice that it is not until 0:07 that the officer actually identifies himself as a state police officer.  <div align="center"><object height="245" width="400"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/BHjjF55M8JQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" name="movie" /><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" /><param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="245" class="floatcenter" width="400" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/BHjjF55M8JQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></div>What really surprises me (and may be why there is no audio for the first video) is that in Maryland it is illegal to audio record anyone without their direct knowledge.  When the rider released the video to Youtube the Maryland State Police issued a search and arrest warrant for the rider.  They went to his home and raided it and took him into custody on federal charges.  They seized 2 computers, 2 laptops and the riders helmet camera that was mounted to the top of his helmet in plain view.  I read somewhere that the officer directly asked the guy if he was recording and they stated that he said no.  However in the videos and interviews that I have seen I have heard nothing to that effect.  Again in this situation I feel that the only thing the officer did wrong was not identify himself prior to taking any action.  I would have reacted the same was if I were the rider and some guy just jumped out of his car and pulled a gun..  Actually I probably would have sped off around traffic, especially in the city because you never know if someone wants to steal your bike or rob you for anything.  As for the guy facing federal charges for releasing the video I find that to be ridiculous, while he broke the law releasing the video police officers should not be allowed to avoid the public eye.  Situations like the next one need to be seen by all people and the officer held accountable.This next video took place in Salem, MA and I personally feel the officer went way overboard and should have been held accountable for his actions.  I am not sure if he has been held accountable or not I am just stating my feelings about the situation, he very well may have been.  In this one it seems there was trouble at a local pub in Salem (when is there not..) which caused the police to arrive.  It seems like they had the situation under control and the people being held accountable were taken into custody.  You notice that an officer is putting someone into the cruiser at 0:16 and then at 0:23 another officer starts to get into the drivers side of the car and then stops, turns to someone in the crowd and starts saying &quot;Get out of here or you&#39;re next&quot;, and continues to say &quot;get the f*ck out of here&quot;.  The people seem to be listening as they are walking away.  At this point the officer grabs the guy by the throat and puts him to the ground.  You can also hear other officers telling the guy to turn the camera off and they must have been approaching him as you can hear him say &quot;No I can do this&quot; and then suddenly he stops filming.<div align="center"><object height="245" width="400"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/xutDJ3wqIeQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" name="movie" /><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" /><param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="245" class="floatcenter" width="400" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/xutDJ3wqIeQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></div>It is my personal opinion that this officer went well out of bounds here.  He had no right or reason to touch that guy especially since he was walking away from the scene.  The officer should have just gotten into his cruiser and been on his way to the station rather than getting in deeper with people standing there watching.  I could not tell in the video if the person said anything to the police but I could not hear anything come out of his mouth but I sure did hear the officer spatting off when he started doubling back.There is a fine line when it comes to police abusing their power and there are tons of instances where people cry police brutality when in-fact they have the right AND responsibility to use all necessary force.  In this next video you will see an elderly lady wielding a knife at people in a Wal-Mart parking lot.  At 0:30 the police arrive and ask the woman nicely to put the knife down (I probably would have told her to put it down but that&#39;s besides the point.).  The woman does not want to cooperate so the female officer takes the necessary actions and takes the old woman to the ground.  People started talking racism and police brutality.  Here is a classic example where the police are using appropriate force.  The woman is approaching the female officer while not cooperating by putting down the knife.  The woman officer then takes the woman to the ground and restrains her.  Was she injured in the take down?  It sure looks like it because there is blood on the ground but was too much force used?  In this case I do not think so.<div align="center"><object height="245" width="400"><param value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Gv7qyXvoM5E?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" name="movie" /><param value="true" name="allowFullScreen" /><param value="always" name="allowscriptaccess" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="245" class="floatcenter" width="400" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Gv7qyXvoM5E?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always"></embed></object></div>Please leave your thoughts about the above videos in the comments below.</p>
