<p>Most of you probably do not yet know but I have resigned from <a href="http://www.tattomedia.com/">Tatto Media</a> and have moved back to <a href="http://www.namespaceinc.com/">Namespace, Inc.</a>.  While I am under a confidentiality agreement I cannot state what I was working on at <a href="http://www.tattomedia.com/">Tatto Media</a> however what I can say is that I was working with the latest technologies such as <a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>, <a href="http://www.jquery.org/">JQuery</a>, CSS, etc to work on the products that <a href="http://www.tattomedia.com/">Tatto Media</a> has to offer.  Since I have moved back to <a href="http://www.namespaceinc.com/">Namespace Inc</a> I have been reading up on a completely new framework.  Most of you are probably thinking oh another PHP framework under your belt…  That’s not the case at all.  The new framework that we are using is a Java based framework called Wicket.</p>

<p>So far <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Wicket</a> seems to be a very nice web framework and Java is very appealing to me from a developers standpoint.  I guess the good part is that PHP is based on Java quite a bit so picking up the language has been rather easy.  I have also applied for an editor account on <a href="http://www.wicketbyexample.com/">Wicket by Example</a> so you will find anything I write about <a href="http://wicket.apache.org/">Wicket</a> on that site.  I may or may not publish the articles on this site as well I am just not sure yet.  Regardless I will post something here stating that a new example or article has been posted by me.</p>
