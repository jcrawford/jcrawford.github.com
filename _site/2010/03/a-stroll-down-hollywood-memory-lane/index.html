<p>Over the last year my step son Dylan has been asking me to get him movies from Netflix.  He loves watching movies and has watched all of the &quot;new-release&quot; movies for the last few years.  He was not sure what movie he wanted but knew that he wanted a movie that he had not seen before.  My fiance Claire and I picked out a few movies from our child hoods.  My pick was my child hood favorite &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;.  Now when he got the movie in the mail and we let him watch it I was amazed at what was in this movie.  I never recalled him smoking cigars, drinking beer or even the naked duck in the tub in the beginning of the movie.  While all of this content is harmless because you see it on TV everyday it made me think..  There was nothing wrong with a kid watching this movie when I was growing up but today it seems like it would not be suitable for most kids.Last week my fiance picked out &quot;Stand by Me&quot;  which is a classic that we both watched as kids.  It was nice seeing Kiefer Sutherland in something other than &quot;24&quot;.  I never knew he was in this movie however until after I had been watching the show 24 for several years now.  He was so young in this movie and I was a bit thrown after watching this movie.  I did not remember the kids smoking cigarettes, swearing like they did.  I was also surprised that they carried a gun.  You have to keep in mind the kids in this movie are 12 years old and the things they do are not suitable for children to do these days.  Now the movie was made in 1986 and was set in the 50&#39;s/60&#39;s i believe.  He watched it because it was a classic movie however we told him that kids never really did those things and that it was just a story.Are there movies from your child hood that you remember but don&#39;t recall just how &quot;bad&quot; it was?</p>
