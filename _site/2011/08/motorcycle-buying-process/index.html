<p>You may or may not have read that my motorcycle was stolen on July 7th. but it was and this entry will be all about the experience I had while shopping for a new motorcycle.  When my 2008 CBR 600RR was stolen I was more heartbroken than angry, don&#39;t get me wrong I was pissed but it hurt more.  I filed the police report, contacted my insurance company (Progressive) and started the claims process.  Two weeks later I had a check in my hand from Progressive to go out and get a new bike.&lt;!--more--&gt;I wanted to see how logical it was for me to purchase a 2011 CBR 600RR (non-abs) so I called Progressive to get a quote on the 2011.  I knew it was going to be high because they were charging me about $380/mo for the 2008.  I was shocked and almost soiled my pants when they guy told me it was going to cost $689 per month ($8268/year) to insure the 2011 CBR 600RR.  I asked why it was so much and the guy could not answer.  I also informed him that I was only paying $9671 for the bike and the insurance payments would have almost paid for the bike in 1 year.  He didn&#39;t know what to say nor did it sound like he cared.  I almost threw the idea of getting a 2011 out the window after hearing that but I was told by other riders that they were being insane and to call Commerce Insurance.  I called them up and sure enough Progressive was robbing me.  I have 2 points on my license from an illegal pass on right from last year.  It was bogus as the car was turning left but the cop wanted to nab me anyway.  I got the fine dropped down but I forgot to mention to the court that I wanted the points dropped and not the fine.  Anyhow even with 2 points Commerce insurance wants about $1440 per year which is $120 per month MUCH BETTER!I ended up buying the 2011 from Cycles128 in Beverly, MA and had it packed with warranties and anti-theft solutions (2).  I know I went overboard but better safe than sorry in my book and believe me for the 2 weeks I didn&#39;t have the bike I WAS SORRY!  I tried to get Cycles128 to drop all of the insane charges such as admin fee, freight fee, etc but they wouldn&#39;t because they were already lowering the price on the bike.  It took another 4 days and 3 visits to Cycles128 before I could take my bike home.  They were also waiting on a second check that I got due to the theft and secondary insurance I had on the bike.  They called me a few times and told me everything was ready only for me to arrive and they had not communicated with each other, sucked that they did not communicate and I had to waste my time going there several times.  After I had the bike for 2 days I noticed my fairing was almost falling off on my way home from work.  When I got home I checked all the visible bolts and 90% of them were loose!  It was not solely the fairing bolts either it was the bolts on the handlebars, the bolts under the passenger seat holding the tail on, etc.I know the bikes have a lot of vibration and such stuff should be expected but on a brand new bike on day 2 90% of the bolts should not be loose, that tells me whomever put the bike together didn&#39;t do it properly.  I took the bike in the day after it happened and had them put a wrench on all of the bolts and make sure everything was tight.  I was missing 2 bolts so the put in new ones however I think they are the incorrect bolts because the fairing still pulls out and you can see the bolt tilting when it happens.  I have my 600 mile service this weekend and I plan to have them double check the hardware they used or see if it was just put together wrong.All in all I love the 2011 it has been a fun ride even though I have not really been able to push it because of the break-in period.If you have learned anything from this it&#39;s that you should STAY FAR FAR AWAY from Progressive for Motorcycle Insurance.</p>
