<p>Last night was a special night.  It was an extreme supermoon.  What is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoon">supermoon</a>?  Last night was special because the moon was the closest to the earth that it has been in 18 years.  The moon was 221,000 miles away from the earth and it was a full moon at the same time.  I took a few shots but I liked this one the best.  You can see a full list of all supermoons by visiting <a href="http://www.astropro.com/features/tables/cen21ce/suprmoon.html">this site</a>, note that all dates listed for 2011 are in-fact supermoons.  The X just means an extreme supermoon as it was last night.</p>
