I am always looking for ways to save money and learn about new products.  When I stumbled upon GeekAlert's <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/apple-store-coupons/">Apple Store promo code</a> section I quickly bookmarked the page, I also found they have a <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/thinkgeek-coupon/">ThinkGeek coupon</a>.  Saving money is great but saving money on Apple Products is even better.  Now GeekAlert is not just a site which offers coupons and savings but they also provide news about the latest cool <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/">new gadgets</a>, quirky gizmos, and geeky stuff.  It's a great site if you are crazy about all the new gadgets that come out on the market.  Looking through the site some of my favorite posts are the <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/giant-beer-glass/">Giant Beer Glass</a> which everyone should own. <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/cold-maintaining-stainless-steel-drinkware/">Stainless Steel Drinkware</a> is always a nice thing to have.  It just looks good and also keeps your drinks colder for a longer period of time.

	How much fun would it be to take a shot from a  <a href="http://www.geekalerts.com/gummy-shot-glasses/">Gummy Shot Glass</a> and then eat the glass for the chaser. I wonder how many people would try to stop you from eating what they think is glass.  Could you see the look on your friends face when you take a bite out of it and start chewing?  I could see this getting expensive if the glasses taste really good I would be getting a new shot glass with every round.  I wonder just how sweet they are?  Anyone actually tried them before?

	I will admit there is some hardcore geeky stuff on this site and though I am not a hardcore geek I found it interesting and fun to browse. So what are some of your favorite geeky posts?
