One of the nurses had suggested a few places but it was Sunday and they were not open.  Another one of the nurses said that Dorian's Pizza was pretty good.  When we called they were courteous taking out order.  About an hour later we got a call that our food was there so I went down to the lobby and paid.

	When I returned to the room and opened the pizza's they looked really good.  However after the first bite all we could taste was burned pizza.  We looked at the bottom to find that both pizza's were in-fact burned.  Charmaine called the restaurant to complain about the food,.  When she told them that the pizza's were burned he got defensive and said that he himself just cooked the pizza's and that they were not burned.  They were just done...  He was being really sarcastic with her on the phone and when she finally asked if there was anyone else there that she could speak with he said "would you like to talk to the driver?".  With all the sarcasm given to her on this conversation she hung up on the guy.

	I called back and asked to speak to the manager, he said that it was him and identified himself as Jared Meshane.  I asked him what could be done about the burned pizza's and he asked what I would like to be done.  When I said that I wanted a refund for the pizza's he immediately said no.  He was also being sarcastic with me and got fed up with this.  I got off the phone and decided to try to find out who the owner was so that I could contact them.  I went to GoDaddy.com and did a look-up on their website domain name.  I found out the information and e-mailed the e-mail that was on file.  We have not heard back from them.  When I actually took the time to look at their website I had to laugh.  I am not sure who they have doing the work on their site but it sure does look like a 12 year old did the page.  Take a look at the <a href="http://www.dorianspizza.com/">Dorian's Pizza</a> website for yourself.

	The only question I have is what is going on with customer service these days?  If the pizza was just bad pizza I would brush it off and never order from there again.  When you receive something of this quality for the prices they charge you would expect the situation to be rectified.  The end result was with us having to order pizza from Franco's Pizza which was surprisingly good after that last experience.

	We also found out that if you do some research you will find that the only 2 reviews Dorian's has on Google are negative reviews.
