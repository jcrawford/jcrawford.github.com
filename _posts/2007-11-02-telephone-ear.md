title: Telephone Ear
---

I know at some point everyone has had the dreaded telephone ear.  It's when you are on the phone for so long your ear starts to hurt.  That happened to me today.  I was on the phone for a whopping 3 hours and 35 minutes.  When I got off the phone my ear was lost without the phone.    
  
I don't think I have talked this much on the phone for about 7 years.  Anyway it's time to let the ear get some rest ;)
