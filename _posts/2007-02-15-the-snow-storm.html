We ended up getting about 26-30" of fresh snow just during yesterday's snow storm.  If you look at this van it is completely covered with snow.  Look at the door handles and where they are in proportion to the snow.  I have not seen snow this deep in a few years (except on Killington).  The owner of this van is going to have one heck of a time digging the van out of the snow.  I am going to have to do some digging but I am going to have to do some digging as well.

As time passed and the snow accumulated this is what the final result was.  Do you want to sit in the chair?  Once again I am just floored by how much snow we got last night.  I could not even find the child-sized Adirondack chair that we bought our son.  It is just buried under the white blanket.  I am hoping that the snow does not stay for long, it is cold and wet and I do not particularly like the cold.  It would be different if I could afford to hit the mountain and go boarding but it's too expensive.  Without boarding the snow is useless, it makes for nasty driving conditions and COLD!

I just heard that this is the 2nd largest snow storm in the Champlain Valley.  It has taken the record for the largest snow storm in the history of Vermont for the month of February.  I am actually a bit surprised that I have not lost power or the Internet.  They are generally the first to go in a large storm like this.  Last night I did have to go out on the roads real quick and within a mile and a half I saw 4 cars stuck.  I tried to help some of them, and before I made it back home I needed to be pulled out.  I moved to the right just a bit too far because an oncoming car started to slide my way and even with 4-Lo I had no chance.  I did not really go off the road it's just that too much snow had built up under my car and it was all ice under the snow so there was no traction.  When I did make it home I could not get the car pulled forward all the way into the driveway.  I was not in the road, the car was fully in the driveway it just would not pull forward all the way even in 4-Lo.
