title: Prudential Center Boston

Before I really begin to dive into this post I have to thank my wonderful fiancé Claire for allowing the weekend to be all about me and taking photos.  Saturday morning we went down to Lynn beach so that I could get some sunrise photos around 6:30am and then on Sunday we took a ride to Newburyport, MA so that I could see the Bald Eagles in the wild.  I would have loved to have gotten a nice shot of these magnificent birds but my main concern was seeing them in the wild.  They have slowly been making a comeback in the wild but I have never seen them outside of a zoo setting.<!--more-->After going to Newburyport, MA we made a stop to have some lunch and then drove into Boston to check out the Prudential Center.  I had never been there but a co-worker was telling me that it would be a great place to take photographs from.  Boy was he not lying.  The views from the 50th floor of the building were astonishing.  You could see everything from that high up, I could even see a friends house in Nahant, MA.  Of-course I could not see it with my naked eye but when I put my Canon 70-200mm f/4 L lens on the camera sure enough I could zoom in enough to see the building.I would have loved to have been up there during a Red Sox game because you could see everything in the field from that high up.  The view was just amazing but it was difficult to get some decent shots.  The one thing I think they could do better is to hire someone to walk around all day long wiping down the glass with windex.  Too many people were plastering their faces up against the glass leaving oily residue on the glass.  As it started to get later into the evening I also noticed that all of the lights from inside the building were reflecting off the windows.  This made it really tough to get a decent shot that did not include a reflection of the building interior.  There were a few times where I had to use my remote to trip the shutter and be standing in a certain spot while also having my fiancé stand in another spot so that we could block the reflections the best we could.Out of all the pictures I took that day there is one that really grabs my attention.  I am not yet sure why but there is just something about it.  I think it has to do with the way the lighting was at that exact time.  I am not sure what the name of this church is but the way the light hit the tower just drew my attention to it.  I was originally planning to spend the entire day in Boston taking photographs of anything that caught my eye.  However it was freezing cold Sunday so we tried to remain close to the warm Prudential Center.  Once the weather gets a bit warmer I am going to make another trip into Boston and take more shots from ground level.  I love to take photographs and hope to continue getting better and better at photography.  If you are an experienced photographer I would love to get some constructive criticism on what you think I have done wrong or could have done better in the photos above.  I want to continue to learn and being so new to photography I know I have made mistakes (I can tell from the many over/under exposed and blurry pictures I have taken).  The shot of the church was taken with the following settings: f/4.0 1/800 sec ISO 100.If you wish to provide your feedback on my photos please use the comment section below.
