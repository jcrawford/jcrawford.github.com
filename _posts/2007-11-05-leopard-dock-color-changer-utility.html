<p>I was reading TUAW and I noticed a post all about the Leopard Dock.&nbsp; People have not been liking the default dock so it's a good thing that it is so easy to customize.&nbsp; A utility that I found today called <a href="http://www.elgebar.com/dockcolor.html">Dock Color</a> gives you the ability to change the color of your dock with a nice easy to use color wheel. Now this utility does alter system files and accidents do happen, however I have used this and it works very slick.&nbsp; I would love to see a utility that would allow you to alter all aspects of the dock such as color, remove the shelf, change the indicator icons etc.&nbsp; There are seperate utilities that will allow you to do different things but it would be nice to have an all in one package.</p>
