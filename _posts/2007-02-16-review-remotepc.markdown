[![RemotePC Logo](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/rpcn_logo_06.jpg)](http://www.remotepc.com/ "RemotePC Logo")The other day I was at a friends house and they brought up the need to be able to access a remote windows machine from their windows machine at home.  We did some searching and found a few options, we decided that paying the high prices for applications that do this was not an option.  We found [RemotePC Remote Access](http://www.remotepc.com) a website that has a small utility that you will install on your computers, that will allow them to interact so that you can remotely control the computer.  We have yet to sign-up but they offer a 30-day trial and the plans start at $4.95 per month.  He is going to test this service over the next few days and I will update this post with the results of the test.One thing that I think is really cool is that this is not like the typical remote desktop application.  You could actually host a meeting where you control the desktop and allow others to view it in real time.  This would have been helpful in past jobs that I had where we would all be on a conference call.  If we could have all logged into the remote machine to view exactly what the person was talking about it would have made things so much easier.The only thing I could wish for is that this was for all platforms, Linux and OS X would be nice to see as an added benefit.![](http://www.counttrackula.com/tracker/images/3926/3108.gif)
