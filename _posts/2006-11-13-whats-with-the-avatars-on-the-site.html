<p>Some of you may have noticed that I integrated Gravatars however I had to quickly disable them because it was taking forever for a page to load that had a lot of comments.&nbsp; I am going to look into the ability of making the comments have a paging mechanism (even write my own if I have to) and then i will turn them back on.&nbsp; I would love to make use of the Gravatar system but it will also depend on the speed at which the service runs.&nbsp;</p>
