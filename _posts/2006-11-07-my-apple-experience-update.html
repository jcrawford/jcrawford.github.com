<p>Re: One Bad Apple in the Bunch</p><p>I do apologize for not following up on this sooner.&nbsp; I have been busy working on the site.&nbsp; So the last I mentioned Apple replaced my display after repairing the first one 3 times and sending it back in worse condition each time.&nbsp; When I received the display it had a few dead pixels (not too many) but the ones that were dead were right smack in the way.&nbsp; I called Nate Doss (Apple Executive Team) and he told me that they could offer me a good will gesture from Apple for my experience.&nbsp; He could replace the display again or he could give me a coupon for the online store that would get me $30 off from a $100 purchase.&nbsp; I declined that.</p><p>The next day I called Nate again and told him that if he felt my experience was only worth a $30 coupon where I had to buy apple products to get the good will gesture then I did not want it.&nbsp; After a bit he offered to replace my display or give me a free iSight.&nbsp; I accepted the iSight because the new display that they sent me is covered under my apple care, so if I have more problems with it I can send it back in to get repaired.</p><p>I just hope that I do not EVER have to send it back in again, 3 times within 5 months is enough.&nbsp; I do not want to go through this experience again it was horrible.&nbsp; Anyhow if you go through things like this with Apple don&rsquo;t back down.&nbsp; They were clearly in the wrong and tried to get out of the situation without any loss.&nbsp; I was really to the point where I was talking with an Attorney about the lack of competence the Apple Technicians had.&nbsp; They solved the situation however I doubt I will ever buy another Apple display, I would go with Dell since they use the same LCD panels as Apple.</p>
