<p>Recently i saw the movie Click, if you have not seen this movie you need to.&nbsp; It's the new movie with Adam Sandler where he works all the time to make ends meet.&nbsp; He winds up aquiring a universal remote control that controls more than he wanted.&nbsp; The remote actually controls his life, he can mute people, fast forward, go on auto pilot etc.&nbsp; This movie really hit me, I tend to work more than i should and i miss out on quite a bit with my family.&nbsp; If you are a workaholic you should watch this move, maybe it will make you slow down on your career :)</p><p>I do not want to miss out on anything with my family and this movie has made me re-think some things.&nbsp; Yet another blockbuster hit from Happy Maddison Productions and i look forward to seeing what they come up with next.&nbsp;</p>
