<p>Amazon launched its own video download service on Thursday called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox">Unbox</a>.&nbsp; They are offering you 1 free TV Show download ($1.99 value) so that you will try thier service.&nbsp; I quickly ran over to download a TV Show only to find that in order to download a show you need to use the <a target="_blank" title="Unbox Video Player" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/help/install-client.html/103-0237886-4912656">Unbox Video Player</a>.&nbsp; I half expected this, however what i did not expect is a <a target="_blank" title="Microsoft Windows" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">Windows</a> <em><strong>ONLY</strong></em> software.&nbsp; I figured someone as big as <a target="_blank" title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> would have a cross platform application that would run on <em><strong>ANY</strong></em> operating system.&nbsp; I was wrong, so i turned on my computer that is running <a target="_blank" title="Windows Vista" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx">Vista Pre-RC1</a>, downloaded the installtion files and started the process.&nbsp; Wow wouldn't you know it the application will not install.&nbsp; It requires <a target="_blank" title="Windows XP" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx">XP SP 2</a> or <a target="_blank" title="Windows 2003" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx">Windows 2003</a>.&nbsp; Already i am not a fan of <a target="_blank" title="Amazon Unbox Video Service" href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox/">Unbox</a>, although i have not been able to test the quality of the video's they are claiming them to be DVD quality.&nbsp; Every purchase also comes with 2 files, one for you to watch on the computer/tv and the other for portable devices.&nbsp; I am guessing they mean <a target="_blank" title="Microsoft Windows" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">Windows</a> based portable devices so all of you iPod owners are out of luck.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox/" title="Unbox Video Service" target="_blank">Unbox</a> will offer both TV Shows and Movies for sale.&nbsp; You can buy a movie for $7.99-$14.99 and TV Shows are $1.99.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/unbox/" title="Unbox Video Service" target="_blank">Unbox</a> is taking it one step furthur and offering rentals.&nbsp; You can pay $3.99 for a rental which will disable itself 24 hours after you watch it.&nbsp; I think this is a good idea since $3.99 is the typical rental price and the costs for making the DVD packaging would offset the cost of the movies here.</p><p>I really do hope <a target="_blank" title="Apple Computer" href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> starts the Movie service everyone is talking about, and i hope that they are cross platform so that everyone can enjoy the service that <a target="_blank" title="Apple Computer" href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> will provide.&nbsp; I cannot express enough how unimpressed i am with <a target="_blank" title="Amazon" href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> today.</p>
