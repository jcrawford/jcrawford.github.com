<p><img alt="" src="http://tinyurl.com/2539rf" />I was reading a post today on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ynveow">formykountry</a> that gives you the choice of <a href="http://formykountry.com/?p=88">sex or ice cream</a>.&nbsp; You are stranded on a tropical island with all the food/shelter etc. that you need.&nbsp; Every afternoon you get the choice of a companion of the opposite sex for 30 minutes or you can have ice cream.&nbsp; They talk about what a 19 year old with rocks in their pants will choose vs someone who knows what sex is all about.&nbsp; My solution to the issue of not being able to have both...&nbsp; One day choose the ice cream, save it somehow (even though it will melt), the next day have a little fun with the saved melted ice cream ;)  </p>
