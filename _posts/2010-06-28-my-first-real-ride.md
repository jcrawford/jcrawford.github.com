title: My First Real Ride
---
As you may have read I [recently bought a sport bike](http://www.josephcrawford.com/2010/06/14/our-new-bike/).  I finally got my permit on Friday and did all the necessary steps to get it on the road legally.  Now what you may not know is that in the past I did ride a 4 stroke dirt bike but that was back when I was 8 and it was not something I got to ride daily as it was my friends bike.  Up until Friday you could basically say I had very little to no experience riding a bike.  I started out Friday afternoon by riding in [this small cemetery](http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=41+Grant+St,+Lynn,+Essex,+Massachusetts+01902&t=h&ll=42.489615,-70.971159&spn=0.003216,0.008256&z=18) in Lynn, MA (only because it was directly across the street from where my bike was stored until street legal).  After riding for about 2 hours Friday I decided to call it a day and spend the rest of the day with my family.  Saturday we woke up and spent a few hours at the beach and then I went riding for a few hours and got the bike inspected.  After riding for about 4 hours I felt I had a good feel for how the bike handled (I am not an expert by any means, just had a good feel for the bike).  Saturday afternoon my fianc√© Claire asked if I wanted to go visit her mother in North Adams, MA.  I thought about it for a minute and checked the weather reports.  Saturday and Sunday looked clear so I thought why not.  There were a few challenges I saw on the trip mainly the Mohawk Trail portion of the ride, however I was also a bit nervous about the highway as I had not yet ventured that far nor had I hit those speeds.  I started out nice and slow in the slow lane and after a few minutes of riding at speeds of 60-70 I was comfortable.  I did find that at those speeds you have to basically lay on the bike to cut down the wind resistance because the wind was trying to blow me all over the place.The best part of the entire ride by far was the Mohawk Trail.  There were plenty of curves and it was a nice ride because it was not all stop and go like it is down here in the city.  I did not really push the bike too much because I am still a new rider and have not yet taken the riders course.  The ride was quite long as it took us almost 3 hours to drive.  I was a bit numb when we arrived especially where my legs meet my pelvic area but overall I think I did pretty well.  The most challenging part of the entire ride for me was [this hairpin turn](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=&sll=42.700915,-73.108715&sspn=0.102564,0.264187&g=north+adams,+ma&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=&ll=42.708575,-73.062692&spn=0.003205,0.008256&t=h&z=18) ([photo](http://www.panoramio.com/photo/2817232)) found just before you get into North Adams, MA.  I thought for sure I was going to dump the bike because it was my first time really attempting this maneuver and it was a tough one because of how tight the corner is.  I was able to make it around the turn without a hitch, I just let the bike lean at about 15 MPH and kept my body upright as the motorcycle manual stated to do when you are taking sharp turns real slow.  I even nailed it when we were on our way home Sunday but I was a bit more nervous because it was going uphill and I cut the corner tight using the shoulder of the road which had some loose gravel and oil stains from vehicles traveling over it for so many years.The entire trip went well and I got to put about 450 miles under my belt which I think was a good thing.  The more time you get to ride the better you will get.  I have outlined [the entire route](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Lynn,+MA&daddr=42.450821,-71.368561+to:North+Adams,+MA&geocode=Fcv9hwIdimXF-ymv5YJtMg7jiTFTSGu3IT5Jiw%3B%3BFXOQiwIdFXOk-ynrUOrlibfgiTHtlMw7a4djTg&hl=en&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=10&via=1&sll=42.560161,-71.716003&sspn=0.822359,2.113495&ie=UTF8&ll=42.724821,-71.548462&spn=1.640352,4.22699&t=h&z=9) which I rode on Google Maps so feel free to take a peek if you are not familiar with Route 2.
