Tonight my new baby boy was born.  Paxton Robert Crawford 8lb 12oz, 19" long.  It has been a long tiresome day so I will make this short.  I will be taking a few days off from work to take care of the new baby and my girlfriend.  There were complications during delivery so they had to go in and remove the baby.  Things will be quite hectic around here for the next few days.
