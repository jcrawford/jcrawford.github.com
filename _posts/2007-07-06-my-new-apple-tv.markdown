Well I have had some time to play with my new toy and I must say that I love it!Â  I have had no reason to put any movies, music or pictures on the device because streaming works so well.Â  When I first tested it out I did so with my wireless-g linksys WRTP54G router.Â  It worked wonderfully.Â  I decided to try my girlfriends Belkin wireless-n router and immediately removed that.Â  With the wireless-n router from Belkin it would not stream the movies without interruption.Â  Every few moments it would have to buffer the movie again.Â  However with the wireless-g it works like a charm.I am looking into opening up my AppleTV and making it so that it can play other formats than only those that iTunes supports.Â  I have seen people modify them so that they can play Divx and Xvid and there are also some other cool plugins like checking weather and rss feeds etc.Â  The only issue I have with modifying this myself is the fact that the rubber base is held on with what looks like a rubber based glue.Â  All of the articles I have read say to re-apply the rubber base with a spray adhesive but they do not specify what type to use.The only thing I would suggest is this.Â  If you do not plan to use the AppleTV as a portable unit then go with the 40GB model.Â  Everything streams fine and you will not need more space than that.Â  I got the 160GB model because I was a bit hesitant on how well the streaming would work.Â  It works perfect for me and I doubt I will use the extra space.
