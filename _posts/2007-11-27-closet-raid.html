<p>I have been thinking about setting up a raid server in my closet that will run on Wi-Fi.&nbsp; I would like to do this because any computer in the house would be able to access the share.&nbsp; When I first started to think about getting a backup system I thought about getting a ReadyNAS NV+ which is a device you can put up to 4 hard drives in and have RAID 5 which is a great bonus.</p>  <p><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/3ware.jpg" class="floatleft" alt="3ware" />I searched around and found that the ReadyNAS NV+ costs $1,049.00 (directly from NETGEAR) as an empty unit (meaning no hard drives).&nbsp; I found this to be quite expensive for lack of growth that it offers.&nbsp; You can only have 4 drives, they can be no larger than 750GB each.&nbsp; You are limited to 3TB of storage space.</p>  <p>I have been pricing out all the hardware I would need to setup a massive RAID system and actually it's a lot cheaper than I thought it was going to be.&nbsp; The main PC components such as case, motherboard, processor, memory, power supply only run about $450.&nbsp; The kicker though and what is stopping me right now is the fact that if I do this I want to do it right.&nbsp; I have been looking at a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/product/product.asp?item=N82E16816116059">3ware</a> SATA II RAID Controller card that will support up to 16 SATA II drives.&nbsp; It is quite pricey though.&nbsp; It is $749.99 just for the PCI-X card.</p>  <!--more-->  <p>You might be saying to yourself &quot;christ just buy the Infrant&quot; but with this system I would not be limited to the&nbsp; amount of space like 3TB.&nbsp; In theory if it was financially possible I could throw 16 1TB drives in the case and have a heck of a server.&nbsp; I do not plan to do that though, I will wait for the cost of the drives to drop ;)</p>  <p>I plan to start off with 3-4 500GB SATA drives and every month or so throw another drive or 2 at it&nbsp; You must be thinking why does he need all of that storage space?&nbsp; Truthfully I don't but it will be nice to know you will never ever run out of storage space.&nbsp; I am going to start buying the pieces to this system over the next few months and hopefully have it built by February of 2008.&nbsp; I also plan to have the machine be a dedicated computer for the <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">seti@home</a> and <a href="http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/">rosetta@home</a> projects.&nbsp; I also plan to use it as my development machine with Apache, MySQL, PHP, SVN, etc all installed.</p>
