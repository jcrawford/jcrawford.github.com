title: Invited to FreshBooks Client Dinner!!
---
Last week I had received an email from Mitch at [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) and he was writing to invite me to dinner on behalf of the company.  Below is the email that I received.> Hey![Mitch](http://freshbooks.cmail2.com/t/y/l/qlhkyt/jrjdydiki/r) from FreshBooks here. [Casey](http://freshbooks.cmail2.com/t/y/l/qlhkyt/jrjdydiki/y) and I are going to be in Cambridge attending the [Boston Design Camp](http://freshbooks.cmail2.com/t/y/l/qlhkyt/jrjdydiki/j) and would love to have you join us for dinner (on us of course) at [Legal Seafoods](http://freshbooks.cmail2.com/t/y/l/qlhkyt/jrjdydiki/t) at Kendall Square. Dinner is on Friday, November 5th at 7:30 pm. It’s going to be a blast. What could be better - free food, fun and awesome people! Feel free to bring a friend – we love friends.Here are the details:Date: Friday, November 5thTime: 7:30 pmPlace: [Legal Seafoods](http://freshbooks.cmail2.com/t/y/l/qlhkyt/jrjdydiki/i), 5 Cambridge Center, Cambridge, MA 02142, 617-864-3400It is super important to RSVP so I know how many people to expect. Please RSVP HERE as soon as possible. That link also includes all the event details.Looking forward to it!Cheers,MitchVP of Marketing - FreshBooksIf you didn't want to receive this email message manage your contact preferences or unsubscribe. I was a bit skeptical because I used the service but had never had any real contact from the company until this e-mail came through.  I quickly replied to Mitch basically saying wait we've never met and you want to invite me to dinner.. What's the catch?  He replied that there was no catch in-fact they probably would not talk about [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) much at all.  Friday came and my fiancé and I went to attend the dinner.  Still a bit skeptical about the whole thing as we were the first to arrive.  I wondered what type of sales pitch we were about to hear because lets be real who in this day in age gives free Legal Seafood away?Well this post should settle those feelings if anyone out there has them.  We went to the dinner and enjoyed wonderful food and drinks and there was not a lot of talk about [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/).  I had told Mitch that the only thing I thought would be beneficial for [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) would be to partner up with an on-line collection agency who could make it easy and affordable for contractors or small businesses to start the collection process...  You know we've all had those clients who don't want to pay the bills.This was a good event and the only suggestion I could make for Mitch and Casey is to make the events a bit smaller.  Maybe hold a few of these dinners in a city if too many people are RSVP'n because I felt there was not enough direct contact with Mitch and Casey.  I would have loved to have been able to talk with them more but they were overloaded with about 50 people who attended and wanted their attention.So if you are feeling a bit caught off guard, don't worry it's a great time and a great night out.A BIG Thank You to [FreshBooks](http://www.freshbooks.com/) and of-course Mitch and Casey!!!
