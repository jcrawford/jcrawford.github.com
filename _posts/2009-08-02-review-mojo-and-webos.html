<p>Over the last few weeks I have been fiddling with trying to learn how to develop applications on the WebOS platform that <a href="http://www.palm.com/">Palm</a> released on their <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/index.html">Palm Pre</a>.  If you are not familiar with WebOS it is an operating system that <a href="http://www.palm.com/">Palm, Inc.</a> has created for the <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/phones/pre/index.html">Palm Pre</a> and their future line of phones.  From this point forward they are not going to release a phone that is not running WebOS.  This means that the old Palm OS is going away.  You use technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, HTML to develop applications on the devices.  Mojo is the JavaScript framework that allows you to access core functionality of the phone such as the location services, calendar, contacts, etc.</p>

	<p>I have been looking through the applications source code for the apps that are bundled with the operating system when you buy a phone so that I can learn.  I have also been reading the &#8220;rough cuts&#8221; version of the WebOS Book.  The book has not been much help since it was in &#8220;rough cuts&#8221; which means it is still being written and a lot of the code was out of date as the framework continued to evolve as the book was being written.  I believe the book is in production and if not will be soon.  The latest version of the PDF still has some errors but they are not complete show stoppers while learning.  I do suggest that if you own the book or are buying the book that you check both the <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155254/errata/">Confirmed Errata</a> and <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/errataunconfirmed.csp?isbn=9780596155254">Unconfirmed Errata</a> as well because I have found several errors even in the latest version over the last 2 days.</p>
	<p>As I begin to learn more and more about the Mojo framework you will be able to find tutorials on my site.  I will probably start out with the List widget because that was the first widget they created and the rest of the framework evolved around it.  I want to dig into the API a bit deeper before I start writing anything to make sure that I completely understand how to use it and do not mislead anyone.</p>
	<p>I do have my first app planned however I cannot reveal what it is going to be for fear someone else will steal the idea and release before I do.  However if you are a designer and would like to partner with me on the project we could split the profits.  I am learning more and more about CSS as I have been going but I have not used it on a daily basis so what you can do in 5 minutes would probably take me 20.</p>

	<p>I am honestly amazed at the things you can do with JavaScript and am loving the fact that I can use this as an excuse to learn a lot more about it.bs</p>
