There is no catch...  Well you do have to be good with graphics design.  <a href="http://ilounge.com/">iLounge</a> is holdong a wallpaper contest and if you are the lucky grand prize winner you could walk away with a <em><strong>FREE</strong></em> iPhone.
<blockquote> The rules are simple: create a high-resolution (1600 wide x 1200 tall) piece of desktop wallpaper featuring any current iPod model - the second-generation iPod shuffle, the second-generation iPod nano, or the fifth-generation iPod (with video) - plus the iLounge.com name. Other than the iLounge name and the image of the iPod, the work must be entirely your original creation, and created for this contest. Photographs and artwork are both acceptable, however, art is strongly preferred. Weâ€™ll pick our three favorite pieces of wallpaper to win one of the following three prizes.</blockquote>
Now iLounge will pay for the costs of the iPhone however the cell phone contract is your responsibility.  There will be a total of 3 winners choosen for this contest so fire up your copy of Photoshop and get to work.  This makes me wish that I was good with graphic design.  Here are the prizes:

<strong>Grand Prize:</strong> One Apple iPhone* ($499, 4GB). Weâ€™ll help one lucky winner buy Appleâ€™s combination cell phone, widescreen iPod, and Internet device - weâ€™ll supply the funds for the iPhone; the cell phone contract is your responsibility.

<strong>Second Prize:</strong> One Apple TV ($299, 40GB). Enjoy iTunes-managed audio, video, and photo content on your widescreen TV with the new Apple TV device.

<strong>Third Prize:</strong> One iPod nano ($199, 4GB) and one iPod shuffle ($79, 1GB) in the winnerâ€™s choice of colors.
