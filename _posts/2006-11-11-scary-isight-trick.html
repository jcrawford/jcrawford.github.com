So as you might see to the left (if you have an iSight) you can see that it was turned on and can be viewed <strike>remotely</strike> locally.  All i am doing is displaying it back to you but....  What could someone else do with this?  It is actually very simple to do.  If you have the development tools installed you open up the Quartz Composer, create a video input, and a billboard.  Then you just drag a line from the video input to the image option on the billboard.

Export it to a QuickTime movie and embed it into your page.  I am going to research this a bit more over the next few days to find out if there is a way to make your iSight block this sort of connection attempt.

If you have any significant information about this hack please do let me know.  I did not find this hack myself actually I found it on a page that led me to <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/lpt/wlg/7409" title="iSight Hijack">this page</a>.

As many have said in the comments it is not possible for anyone to watch you as this is all done locally on your screen.  It's still a cool trick though.  Although it does make me wonder if you could embed JavaScript or something in the page to take a screenshot and send it off in an email.  I will have to find a JavaScript expert to either trash that idea or show some example code.
