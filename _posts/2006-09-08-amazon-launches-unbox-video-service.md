title: Amazon Launches Unbox Video Service
---

Amazon launched its own video download service on Thursday called [Unbox](http://www.amazon.com/unbox).  They are offering you 1 free TV Show download ($1.99 value) so that you will try thier service.  I quickly ran over to download a TV Show only to find that in order to download a show you need to use the [Unbox Video Player](http://www.amazon.com/gp/video/help/install-client.html/103-0237886-4912656 "Unbox Video Player").  I half expected this, however what i did not expect is a [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx "Microsoft Windows") _**ONLY**_ software.  I figured someone as big as [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/ "Amazon") would have a cross platform application that would run on _**ANY**_ operating system.  I was wrong, so i turned on my computer that is running [Vista Pre-RC1](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/default.aspx "Windows Vista"), downloaded the installtion files and started the process.  Wow wouldn't you know it the application will not install.  It requires [XP SP 2](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx "Windows XP") or [Windows 2003](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/default.mspx "Windows 2003").  Already i am not a fan of [Unbox](http://www.amazon.com/unbox/ "Amazon Unbox Video Service"), although i have not been able to test the quality of the video's they are claiming them to be DVD quality.  Every purchase also comes with 2 files, one for you to watch on the computer/tv and the other for portable devices.  I am guessing they mean [Windows](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx "Microsoft Windows") based portable devices so all of you iPod owners are out of luck.

[Unbox](http://www.amazon.com/unbox/ "Unbox Video Service") will offer both TV Shows and Movies for sale.  You can buy a movie for $7.99-$14.99 and TV Shows are $1.99.  [Unbox](http://www.amazon.com/unbox/ "Unbox Video Service") is taking it one step furthur and offering rentals.  You can pay $3.99 for a rental which will disable itself 24 hours after you watch it.  I think this is a good idea since $3.99 is the typical rental price and the costs for making the DVD packaging would offset the cost of the movies here.

I really do hope [Apple](http://www.apple.com/ "Apple Computer") starts the Movie service everyone is talking about, and i hope that they are cross platform so that everyone can enjoy the service that [Apple](http://www.apple.com/ "Apple Computer") will provide.  I cannot express enough how unimpressed i am with [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/ "Amazon") today.
