I do not mean to disrespect anyone's religion here but when you buy a book from someone would you expect to flip open the cover to find reading material about something you did not pay for?  I bought the book "<a href="http://product.half.ebay.com/_W0QQprZ46954879QQcpidZ1329846633">Step Into Xcode</a>" from a seller on <a href="http://half.com">Half.com</a> and when I opened it I found a card which contained a $2 bill and went on about sins and using the lords name in vain.  The way I am looking at it is that is is just another $2 off my book because I am not religious in any way shape or form.

	The main question in my mind is how unethical it is to do something like this?  I could see if I won it in a contest that was held by a church but on Half.com?  Is it a big deal that this was included?  I paid less for my book so I don't care.  Even if there was no money in the item I would have tossed it aside and went on to reading.  Since when do they try to pay you to read about the lord and "try" to convert you.

	I wonder if this guy is doing it for all of their customers.  The person I bought it from is  <a href="http://shops.half.ebay.com/the-book-guy_W0QQmZbooksQQsellerZtheQ2dbookQ2dguy">the-book-guy</a> they do however have 100% feedback at <a href="http://half.com">Half.com</a>.
