title: Bose Companion 5 Multimedia Speakers
---
THe other day I was looking for a new speaker system for my mac pro.  I have been looking at a few different systems from Creative and Bose.  The systems are priced comparably so I decided to go with the Bose system since it offers a 30 day money back gurantee.  I have been listening to music on the [Bose Companion 5 ](http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_PRODUCT_PAGE_EVENT&product=companion5_multimedia_index "Bose Companion 5")system and so far it is pretty good.  I have yet to actually test out a movie.  The system from what I understand is not a 5.1 system.  There are 2 speakers and a sub so I would guess that it is a 2.1 however Bose technology makes it sound like 5.1 quality.I am not sure how much I like the setup yet but the sound quality is pretty nice.  A BIG DRAWBACK is that the system does not come with a remote control.  It does have a control pod that sits on your desk and has a volume knob with one touch mute.  However if I am in bed watching a movie I do not want to have to get out of bed to mute the volume.  It seems that the volume control is not effecting the OS X volume settings so I doubt if even the Apple Remote will help with this and that alone is a bummer.Â  However there is another issue that I have found with the Bose system already and that is the control module has no way to adjust the bass levels.Â  In order to increase or decrease the bass level you have to get to the back of the sub-woofer and turn a knob like so many older systems are setup. There few things Bose could do to increase the usability would be to add a remote control to the setup, this would give the remote control luxury but also would allow for the bass to be changed with the remote so you dont have to climb under the desk to change that.I have also been looking at the [Creative GigaWorks ProGamer G550W](http://creative.com/products/product.asp?category=4&subcategory=25&product=14661 "Creative GigaWorks ProGamer G550W") which is a true 5.1 setup and has wireless rear speakers.  The cost for the both systems is the same $399.  The GigaWorks system comes with a remote which is a big plus.I have been a strong believer in Bose and will give this system some time before I jump to conclusions and return it.  I will try watching a movie on the system later and see just how well the speaker system sounds during a movie.  I will post here again with my findings and whether or not I decide to return the Bose system.
