<p>Recently i was at a meeting where someone brought up the website <a href="http://www.sendoutcards.com/" title="Send Out Cards" target="_blank">Send Out Cards</a>, it seemed like a cool idea for just about anyone.&nbsp; Never again forget to send out those birthday or aniversary cards.&nbsp; The cool part about this service is that you can customize the cards, you can put a picture on the card (and maybe even design the entire card).&nbsp; They will print and mail the cards to whomever you wish.&nbsp; They have an online calendar with an online contact manager.</p><p>This service is not only good for consumers who wish to not miss another birthday, but it will also benefit businesses.&nbsp; It is always nice to send out Thank You cards, or cards to grab a potential customers attention.&nbsp; Maybe you want to send coupons to your loyal customers.&nbsp; There are endless possibilities with this.</p><p>Also if you would like to make money from this system you can get into this as a distributor, i am not 100% educated on this yet, but will find out more and post again with more details on how you can make money from this.&nbsp; For now you can check out the <a href="https://www.sendoutcards.com/cgi-bin/trncustomer.pl?income_opportunities:" title="Send Out Cards - Income Opportunity" target="_blank">Income Opportunities</a> page for more information&nbsp;</p>
