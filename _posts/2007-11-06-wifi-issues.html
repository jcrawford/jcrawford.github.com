<p>Ever since I updated to Leopard I have been having issues with my WiFi network.&nbsp; I seem to be the only system having the issues but then again I am the only one that has a mac.&nbsp; For some reason OS X feels it needs to report to me that the wireless network has been compromised and will be disabled for about a minute.&nbsp; I have never had this issue in the past and am not sure if the router is just not compatible with the mac.&nbsp; It seems to happen every few days and when we looked in the router, there is no way anyone is accessing the network who is not supposed to be.&nbsp; We have it secured with a WPA key.&nbsp; If anyone here has any idea what could be causing this please leave me a comment.&nbsp; I would love to never see this dialog again ;)</p>  <p><img style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1px" src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/wifi.png" alt="WiFi Compromised" />  </p>
