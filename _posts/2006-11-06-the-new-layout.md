title: The New Layout
---

Over the last 2 weeks we have been hard at work to create a very stylish layout for the site that is both functional and appealing.  I think we have hit the target but it would be great to find out what the viewers think.  I have disabled certain parts of the site (plugins) such as ratings etc. so that i can get them migrated back into the new layout and styled properly.

My goal for this site is to be a place where you can find out about new Mac and PHP news, obviously it will probably not be on top like TUAW or SitePoint, however it keeps me busy in my spare time.  I will be bringing on other Author's in the near future who will focus on specific categories.

So what do you have to say?
<div><div><div>{democracy:1}</div></div></div>
