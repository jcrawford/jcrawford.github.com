title: More Motivation to Leave Lynn, MA

Today while I was walking home from school with my little man we noticed the street blocked by a cop car.  Being a curious 5 year old he wanted to go look.  I saw only one car and thought it was probably an accident so why not let him go see what was going on.  We hit the end of the street where it was blocked off and an officer told us if we are walking down that way to stay on that side of the street.Looking down the street I could tell something was going on, I counted 16 Lynn Police cars on top of a few undercover cars.  All of them had lights on so this was "cool" to Dylan.  He saw one guy in handcuffs being put into the car and he said "ut oh, he was bad".I have been watching the papers all day to see what happened and they just posted something not long ago.  It seems 3 armed men stormed a womans house.  Luckilly she escaped and ran to a neighbors house to call police.  This home invasion is just another reason why we need to get out of the city.  We did not see it but the paper says that all 3 men were arrested at gun point.I figured it had something to do with a gunshot that my girlfriend heard come from that area last night, I guess it didn't though.  I don't see anything about that in the paper.You can read more over at [itemlive.com](http://itemlive.com/articles/2008/12/03/updates/doc49383fd71d5f4173628894.txt "Lunching lieutenant busts 3 alleged home invaders")
