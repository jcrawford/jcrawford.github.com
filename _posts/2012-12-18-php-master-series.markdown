What are your plans December 21st?  Other than the world coming to an end [Cal Evans](http://blog.calevans.com/ "Cal Evans") has organized an amazing online PHP conference.  If you are a PHP Developer there will be no better way to spend that day than to attend the [PHP Master Series](http://phpmasterseriesv1.eventbrite.com/ "PHP Master Series") online developer conference.  Seriously if you are a PHP developer **YOU NEED TO ATTEND** this online conference.The line-up of speakers is just **AMAZING**, these are all very well respected people in the PHP Community.  If you have ever attended an on-site conference or you have seen the speaker panel you will know that you would only see a handful of these guys at the conference.  You would also be lucky if they were not speaking at the same time in different rooms and if they were you have the hard decision of who you want to hear speak and what you want to learn. At the PHP Master Series you will be able to see **THEM ALL** back to back, no one is going to be scheduled at the same time, this is just **AMAZING**!  Also not only will you get to see and hear the best of the best talk about topics that would interest any PHP developer you will be able to ask them question in real time and they *may* answer your questions live.  I have not heard anything about it but I am sure if you didn't get your question answered live you could find them on IRC or on Twitter and ask them for an answer or clarification.Every one of these guys are extremely talented and I cannot wait for this event to take place.**OH BY THE WAY DID I MENTION IT'S ONLY <font color="red">$50.00</font>**.  A conference ticket can easilly cost you a thousand bucks not to mention the travel, hotel, etc.  This is an event you **WILL NOT WANT TO MISS**!For the cost of this event let's take a look at the speakers you will hear, I'm sure you have heard a few of these names if not all of them.  If you haven't now is the time to hit Google and see just how good these guys are.- [Matthew Weier O'Phinney](http://mwop.net/)
