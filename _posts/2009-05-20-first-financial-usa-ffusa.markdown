Last week I was contacted by [First Financial USA](http://ffusa.com/), they said that they had found my resume on a website like [Monster.com](http://www.monster.com/) (this is very true as I am seeking work) and that they had a position for me.  They wanted me to attend a conference call where everything would be explained however this is what they stated in the initial contact.

I went ahead today and attended the conference call and right from the beginning they stated that the portion you will hear from the President of the company is pre-recorded so that they do not waste any of our valuable time.  I listened to the recording and then it was back to the live agent.  The agent also had someone from the HR department on the line for a live QA session.  Everyone asked questions that they had and they directed us to a URL where we could sign up to be a company agent.  Before I sign up I wanted to do a little research.  I hit Google and started to type in ‘FFUSA’, as soon as I got to the ‘A’ google suggested a search term of ‘FFUSA scam’.  I decided I would check that out because if they were scamming people I wanted to know before signing up.  What I found is that there are not a lot of posts about FFUSA scamming anyone.  There is one report which I found on [Ripoff Report](http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/268/RipOff0268479.htm).  After reading through this in it’s entirety it seems like there is only one person complaining about the company.  DocBox goes on to state that there are numerous complaints with the Better Business Bureau of Greater Minneapolis.  Doing this search myself I see that there is 0 complaints in one listing and only 1 complaint in the other and this is over the last 36 months.  You can see the results [here](http://www.bbb.org/minnesota/business-reviews/credit-card-processing-service/first-financial-usa-in-plymouth-mn-96034747) and [here](http://www.bbb.org/minnesota/business-reviews/merchant-processing/first-financial-usa-in-medina-mn-96084212).

My question for all of my readers is: Have you tried this out or are you currently an Agent for the said company?  I am considering giving this a shot even though “DocBox” listed out all of the complaints.  I feel he is whining when he should not be.  I am not stating whether he is lying or not but a lot of what he is complaining about is outlined in the “Independent Representative Agreement” that they provided and he willingly signed before becoming an Agent.

Anyone else out there have thoughts on this company?  Have you been screwed by them?  Being that they are working with Chase and Wells Fargo I have a hard time believing that they are scamming anyone.  I am not sure if it is true that they are selling you the hardware at retail prices and then to make a profit you have to charge the merchant even more.  However you see this in all industries.  For instance in the past I worked with web design companies that would charge me the same price they would charge their direct clients for web layouts.  I had to mark-up that price to make a profit from the design sale.  The income from FFUSA is really not meant to primarily come from hardware sales or leases, it is meant to come in the form of Conversion Bonuses and Residual Income.  The hardware sales/lease is a secondary income that they offer.  I am thinking this guy is just complaining because he did not read all of the documents before initialing every page of the agreement and signing it at the end.
