<p>As most of you know I broke my arm about a month ago.&nbsp; Last week I had to have surgery because it was not healing properly.&nbsp; Today I went in for my 1 week visit and had the splint removed.&nbsp; My arm is so bruised it's all yellow and even the palm of my hand is bruised.&nbsp; All of this is par for the course according to the orthopedic surgeon I had (who reminds me of Doogie Howser) as he looks like he is in his late 20's but is actually in his 30's.&nbsp; Anyway I have posted a picture at the tail end of this but I warn it is not for the faint hearted.&nbsp; It is a picture of my incision so if you do not want to see it, do not click the read more link.   </p><!--more-->  <p>&nbsp;<img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/photo-43.jpg" style="border: solid black 1px; padding: 1px;" alt="Incision" />  <p>&nbsp;<img alt="Incision 1" src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/photo-44.jpg" style="border: solid black 1px; padding: 1px;"  /></p>
