<p>Almost everyone know's that Amazon has patented the one click technology (in my opinion it's a crock that anyone can patent a method like that) and that Apple leases the use of the technology from Amazon for thier iTunes store.&nbsp; However what not everyone may know is that the Amazon patent is under review by the U.S. patent and Trademark office.&nbsp; I wonder if anyone will be able to use this method in the future without having to pay Amazon to do so.</p><p>This was revealed to me through a blog post that discussed IBM sueing Amazon over 5 patent infringments. you can read the article on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.macobserver.com/article/2006/10/23.9.shtml">TMO's blog entry</a>. </p>
