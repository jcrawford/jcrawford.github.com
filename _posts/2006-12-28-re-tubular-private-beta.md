title: "Re: Tubular Private Beta"
---

I am a bit surprised.  Since I notified the developer of Tubular about the menu bug he quickly issued Beta 3 which resolves that issue.  There is still the lingering issue of closing the window and not having a way to re-open the window.  It just closes and the application remains in the menubar.  You have to exit the application in the file menu and then re-open it.
