Now I just find this funny.  Microsoft has 2 products that they have really pushed in the last 5 years and they are the Zune and Windows Vista.  Vista is not officially released yet but should be soon.  What I find to be funny is the fact that the Zune is not compatable with the Vista operating system.  Apple get's flamed all the time for making sure things are backward compatable with their operating system, but who on earth would not support FORWARD compatability?
> 
Zune software is compatible with the following operating systems:
- Windows XP Service Pack 2
- Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 Update Rollup 2

**Windows Vista**Windows Vista is not supported at this time. Check back soon for updates.

I am sure that when the final version of Vista is released they will hack it in to work somehow.  What gets me is the fact that Microsoft themselves are blatantly stating that the two are incompatable.  You can see for yourself at the [Zune website](http://www.zune.net/en-US/meetzune/software/OS_not_supported.htm "Zune Incompatable with Vista"). 

I also stumbled upon [this article](http://software.silicon.com/os/0,39024651,39164111,00.htm) which states that Microsoft has said that the Zune will work with Windows Vista once it is officially released.  Everyone would be laughing at Microsoft if it would not work once Vista is officially released.

Now here's the part that really makes me laugh.  I am not sure how much worse they could screw this up.  I think they were trying to go for the cute romantic kid approach that Apple did with the iPod.  Boy did they screw up on this one!  If you take a look at the [Apple Insider](http://www.appleinsider.com/article.php?id=2237 "Apple Insider") article about this you will see the error window that is shown on Vista when you try to install the Zune.  Now the picture they used looks like the girl is in pain as if she was getting run over by a car or something.
