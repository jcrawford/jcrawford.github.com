title: Lesson Learned The Hard Way
---

As some of you may know last month I accepted a position with a company in Boston.  I have been taking the train to State St. every day while commuting to work.  Today I learned a very valuable lesson about city people.  Leave them alone, put on your blinders and ignore everyone and everything.  Today as I got off the train I exited the State St. station and I noticed an older gentleman in a wheel chair trying to cross the street.  This is a rather busy intersection and he was not using his hands on the wheels rather he was slowly scooting along pulling his chair inch by inch with his feet.  I decided that I would ask him if he wanted any help crossing the street.  I approached him and asked:
<!--more-->> 
Excuse me sir, would you like a hand crossing the street?

His reply got everyone that was around to laugh and made me look dumbfounded.  Rather than just saying no but thank you for offering he had the following to say.
> 
NO!!!  You’re an A**HOLE!  I didn’t ask you for help!

I could barely hold it together I said that’s what I am really?  He was half way across the street at this point and he whipped his chair around and started coming back to my side of the road still going on about how I am such a bad guy and that he didn’t ask for help.  Before he had the chance to follow me I ended the conversation with have a nice day sir, enjoy your stroll.  I then turned and walked to work.  I guess he did enlighten several peoples day by making them laugh but when did it become wrong to help the elderly when from your perspective it does not look like they are fully self-sufficient?  I know who am I to judge that but I would rather see him get to the other side safely than hit by a car on the city streets.
