excerpt: Yesterday evening we were on our way to our friend Derek's house in Nahant, MA.  While Claire was driving down the causeway I noticed the sun was projecting these beams of light down through the clouds.  I quickly grabbed my camera and took some shots in Manual mode while trying to quickly choose my settings to get a good shot.

I quickly grabbed my camera and took some shots in Manual mode while trying to quickly choose my settings to get a good shot.  I have not done any post-processing on this image it is straight from the camera.  Please leave your comments below.
