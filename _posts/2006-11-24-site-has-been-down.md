title: Site has been Down
---
I apologize to everyone.Â  Lunarpages (my web host) told me that they had to move me to a different server to increase the site performance.Â  I notified them that there had to be no downtime however they obviously did not check thier work.Â  Yesterday I noticed that the site was down, it was an issue with the WP-Cache installation.Â  I think i have fixed that but I am still having a few other problems that I need to iron out.I am not sure why Lunarpages did not check thier work.Â  I specifically told them that there were 2 domains on the account and they needed to be moved without interruption.Â  They said they understood.Â  Go figure.Â  Maybe it's time to start looking for a new web host.
