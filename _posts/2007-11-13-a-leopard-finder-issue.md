title: A Leopard Finder Issue
---

I have been dealing with the most annoying issue I have found in Leopard's Finder yet.  The issue has to do with a directory not refreshing when open.  When I used Tiger I could have a Finder window open, save a file to the directory and the Finder window would update.  In Leopard however if I download a file to a directory which I have a Finder window open for the file does not show.  I either have to close that Finder window and navigate back to the directory or I have to go up one level in the directory structure and re-open that directory.  I have also noticed that the directory contents will refresh if you delete a file.  I am not sure if it would work with renaming a file but I would assume it would.
  
This is very annoying and If there is an option somewhere I do not know why Apple would not make it the default action.
