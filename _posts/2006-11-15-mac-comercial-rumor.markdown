I am sure by now you have heard the rumor that Justin Long will no longer be making any Mac Commercials.  It has been going around the net like a wild forest fire, however it is not true.  Justin himself posted on his website that the rumor is false.

As for the Mac commercials, I don't know where that report came from that said I wasn't going to do it anymore – I’m literally setting my alarm right now to wake up for a Mac shoot tomorrow -we're doing some holiday spots now which I think will be pretty funny. They’re easy to do, I love John (the pc guy) and working with him is so effortless and fun that I definitely wouldn't rule out doing some more.

We all know that once a rumor hits it is hard to stop it from going any furthur.  I cannot wait to see what they have in store for the holliday commercials, I am sure they will be just as great if not better than the commercials currently released.

If you have not had a chance to take a look at the Mac Commercial Spoofs, you should take a look.  They are pretty comical but some are not child appropriate.  As long as you have a headset they should be work safe, unless you start laughing so loud your boss hears.
