<p>I have been a Zend Certified Engineer for just over a year now and I have to say that I am very pleased with the decision to take the exam.&nbsp; There are several reasons to become a ZCE.&nbsp; The first is that if you try you will see an increase in work or your salary.&nbsp; I run a custom web development company called Codebowl Solutions, Inc.&nbsp; There have been a few contracts that I may not have recieved had it not been for the certification.&nbsp; When you are meeting with a stranger it eases thier mind to know that you are qualified to complete the project that they have available.&nbsp; Sure you can say I have the knowledge to complete that, however the certification puts Zend on your side.&nbsp; I did notice however that I have had to explain to a few people who Zend is and what they have to do with PHP.&nbsp; I think this helped overall also, it shows the client that i know some of the history of PHP.</p><p>When i was preparing to take the exam i reviewed the online PHP manual quite a bit, I also bought the study guide and practice test book.&nbsp; I feel these books had a big impact on my exam results, the study guide was well put together and covered most of the material on the exam.&nbsp; I am by no means stating that you can run out and buy the book and ace the exam.&nbsp; If you have no real world experience using PHP and do not know quite a bit by heart, you will have to dig deep into the online manual and practice before you think about the exam.</p><p>With the release of PHP 5 Zend has created a completely new exam.&nbsp; Does this make the PHP 4 exam obsolete?&nbsp; I do not think so.&nbsp; Yes you may know enough PHP 5 to pass the exam however PHP 4 and 5 have several differences, if you do not know that in PHP 4 you have to pass by reference using the &amp; operator you will find some nice bugs in your code.&nbsp; An employer may like to have the comfort level knowing that you have taken both exams and you can complete any project that is tasked to you.&nbsp; Clients will love the fact that you know both versions, some of the new clients wish to use PHP 5 however most who already have code in place will require PHP 4.</p><!--more--><p>I mentioned before that php|architect has opened a mock testing environment that will aid in your exam preparation.&nbsp; I believe this will be another great tool if you are preparing for the exam.&nbsp; Not only does it cover the material on the exam but they have made the mock test more difficult than the exam itself.&nbsp; Therefore if you score well on the mock test, you should score as well or better on the exam.&nbsp; I just noticed this morning that the <a href="http://www.zceguide.com/" title="PHP 5 Study Guide" target="_blank">PHP 5 study guide</a> has been released, I quickly ordered my copy and await it's arrival.&nbsp; I am a bit late when it comes to preparing for the PHP 5 certification, i just hope that i am within the first 1000 to become certified.&nbsp; When i took the PHP 4 exam i was the 3rd person in the state of VT to become certified, as you can imagine the demand for PHP work here is not that great.&nbsp; There are still only 3 people listed for VT in the <a target="_blank" title="Zend PHP Yellow Pages" href="http://www.zend.com/store/education/certification/yellow-pages.php">Zend PHP Yellow Pages</a>.</p><p>In closing I think that Zend is doing some really great things with the PHP Certification and I look forward to see what comes in the future.</p>
