Today while I was at work I had to request a particular day off through our online tool.  When the request was approved I received an email from the system which wanted a return read receipt.  I allowed it to send the return recipt and then Thunderbird showed a message stating that it was not a valid address and again I clicked ok.  Once I clicked that I got a very funny message which seems to be a debugging step for the developers on Thunderbird 3.  Look below for a screen shot.
