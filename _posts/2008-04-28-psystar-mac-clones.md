![](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/psystar.jpg "psystar")There has been a lot of controversy as to whether or not the [Psystar OpenPro](http://www.psystar.com/index.php?&page=shop.product_details&category_id=3&flypage=flypage_images.tpl&product_id=19&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=72) Mac clone is real or not.  Will it actually make it to the market or will Apple squash the idea.  One person actually [provided a video](http://gizmodo.com/384526/exclusive-video-psystar-in-the-wild) of their machine booting into Leopard.  Now this is a cheap alternative to buying a Mac system but it is very far from a suggestion on my part.  After watching this video and reading what I have about these machines I would never suggest that anyone buy one of these machines.

The sounds that come from this machine are hilarious.  The fans make the system sound like a vacuum cleaner.  Now there are some benefits to getting a machine like this.  It is cheaper than buying a mac system, however you will not get any support from Apple.  Now let's weigh out the cons.
<!--more-->
You will not be able to run the software update.  This is a big one because if you look at how many bug fixes there are in the updates that come from Apple you will see that there are a lot.  In the upcoming release that is expected within the next week or two there are hundreds of bug fixes.  Without the updates you are left open to hackers.  If you are an experienced user I am sure you will be able to find a way to install the updates but it won't be through the software update application and it will be some hacked package that someone has put together.  With this there goes the ease of having a Mac system.

The system is very noisy, I am not sure how many fans they have in the system but in the Mac Pro that I have there are 4 and I rarely ever know the system is running even when sitting right next to it.  The noise levels from that machine would bother me more than anything.  I remember these noisy days from my PC days and I do not miss them.  I was actually amazed at how quite my mac system was when I first got it.  I had to keep looking to make sure it was actually on.

Psystar actually tells the people who buy the system that you are buying a legitimate copy of OS X however if you have issues with your system you will not be able to [reinstall Leopard](http://gizmodo.com/384302/psystar-wont-let-you-reinstall-leopard-by-yourself) yourself.  From what I have read this is because they are actually using the [Osx86 project](http://www.osx86project.org/) which is completely free for people to use.  Now why are they using something that is free and charging for it?  A better question is why are people paying for something they could do themselves for free?  Them selling you a legitimate copy of OS X is their way of getting around Apples software agreements.  So why would you buy a system that you cannot reinstall the OS if there are issues?  Also this claim contradicts what they said before about the system being able to run an un-modified version of Leopard.  It sounds to me like you are buying a hackintosh.

You also have to take a look at the internal components and compare the cost of the system against a comparable Mac system to compare the prices.  They would like to say that the OpenPro Computer they offer is comparable to a Mac pro, however unless you upgrade the CPU, etc. the base price of $999 is not comparable.  There is also only 1 processor in the system, granted you can throw a quad core processor in it to make it compare to the quad core Mac Pro.  Yes even customized to match the processor specs it is cheaper by quite a bit, however the idea of using a hacked operating system, no software updates and no support from Apple.  Is it really worth the money you save?
