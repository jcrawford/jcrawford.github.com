<p>With the integration of Quick Look into Leopard we all thought it would be great if there were 3rd party plug-ins developed for it.&nbsp; Previously <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/2007/11/27/leopard-quick-look-plug-ins/">I wrote</a> and told you about the zip and folder quick look plug-ins. Today I found out that there are 2 websites that are dedicated to archiving QL Plug-ins.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.qlplugins.com/">http://www.qlplugins.com/</a> and <a href="http://www.quicklookplugins.com/">http://www.quicklookplugins.com/</a>.&nbsp; It seems that both of the sites archive the same plug-ins so right now it does not matter which site you use as your source.&nbsp; There seems to be quite a fair amount more of plug-ins being developed.&nbsp; One of my favorites is the BetterZip as it has a nicer interface than the regular zip and it also allows you to view many many different archive formats and not only the zip format.</p>  <p>THere seems to be everything from adobe to textmate integration plug-ins and I cannot wait to see what else people come up with.&nbsp; You can preview movies, flash movies, images, archives, documents.&nbsp; They even have ones that will highlight your code if you are viewing a document with programming code.</p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>
