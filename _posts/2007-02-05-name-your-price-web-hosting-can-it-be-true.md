title: Name your price web hosting can it be true?
---
![](http://www.counttrackula.com/tracker/images/8718/3108.gif)Tonight I was browsing around the web when I came across a web host that actually let's you name the price for your web hosting account.  Obviously they will have to agree with the price.  Have you found another web hosting company that will allow you to say I want 10GB disk space, 15GB transfer, 100 Email accounts, etc. for $15 per month.I have never seen this type of promotion before but I love the fact that they let you specify what you want and pay only for what you need.  I dont need 250GB of transfer or 10 addon domains yet I am paying for them with the account I currently have.  I have to admit I have not tried these services but I might just have to.  I need to find a host that will be more stable than my current host.  And I get to name the price, I just love that part ;)Check out the site and [ 'Name Your Price' for Web hosting](http://www.counttrackula.com/tracker/links/8718/3108)
