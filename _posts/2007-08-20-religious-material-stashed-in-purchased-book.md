title: Religious Material Stashed In Purchased Book
---
I do not mean to disrespect anyone's religion here but when you buy a book from someone would you expect to flip open the cover to find reading material about something you did not pay for?  I bought the book "[Step Into Xcode](http://product.half.ebay.com/_W0QQprZ46954879QQcpidZ1329846633)" from a seller on [Half.com](http://half.com) and when I opened it I found a card which contained a $2 bill and went on about sins and using the lords name in vain.  The way I am looking at it is that is is just another $2 off my book because I am not religious in any way shape or form.The main question in my mind is how unethical it is to do something like this?  I could see if I won it in a contest that was held by a church but on Half.com?  Is it a big deal that this was included?  I paid less for my book so I don't care.  Even if there was no money in the item I would have tossed it aside and went on to reading.  Since when do they try to pay you to read about the lord and "try" to convert you.I wonder if this guy is doing it for all of their customers.  The person I bought it from is  [the-book-guy](http://shops.half.ebay.com/the-book-guy_W0QQmZbooksQQsellerZtheQ2dbookQ2dguy) they do however have 100% feedback at [Half.com](http://half.com).
