![Hair Before](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/before.jpg)For those of you who know me and see me on a day to day basis you were probably accustomed to seeing me with the long hair in the picture to the left.  It all began when I found out that I was going to have my first son Liam.  I decided that I was going to grow my hair until he had his first haircut.  When the time came for Liam to have his first haircut my hair was not that long.  I decided that I was going to continue growing my hair so that when it was long enough I could cut it and donate it.  At first I was going to donate it to Locks of Love however not that long ago I was dating a girl in NY state who had a daughter with both forms of Leukemia that a child can get and one was the rarest form.  The woman tried to get a wig for her daughter from Locks of Love but was turned down because they did not see this as a long term illness.  I have also heard that each year they throw away hair that is not used, I am not sure how true that is.  What I do know is that a child cancer patient was turned down for a wig.  I have decided to donate my hair to Wigs for Kids because they will not turn down a child cancer patient.  If you are curious what I look like please keep reading, I have posted a picture for you to see ;)

![Hair After](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/after.jpg)I know that there are more people out there who could use the wig and not just children but I have been touched by the child and wish to donate to a children's cause.  Today I felt my hair was long enough to donate and it was time to stop procrastinating and just get it over with.  I went to the mall and had my hair chopped.  I do not miss my long hair but what I have found myself doing already was trying to move my hair out of the way.  When I was lying down before I always had to move my hair so that I was not lying on it, I would always move my head and pull my own hair.  Tonight I tried to move hair that was not there.
  
So far everyone has liked my haircut and some did not even recognize me.  I know I like it though, although I found myself feeling a bit colder today.  What are your thoughts?  Be honest :)  
  
Maybe one day I will grow my hair out again and go through this process again.  It is a good feeling knowing that you are able to help someone with a thing like this.  Have any of you donated hair to a cause like this before?  How many times?
  
If any of you work for Locks for Love please let me know if the rumor I heard about them throwing hair away is true.
