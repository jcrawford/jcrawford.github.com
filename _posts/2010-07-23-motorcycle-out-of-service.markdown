excerpt: I hate to even say those words but yes it is out of service at-least temporarily.  I guess when it comes to learning lessons I have no choice but to learn the hard way.  I wanted to start doing routine maintenance on my bike so that I could learn more about the machine so yesterday I started with an oil change.  I made sure to make sure that I was doing everything properly and I first started with removing the oil drain plug and draining the old oil while the machine was still hot from my ride home from work.

I hate to even say those words but yes it is out of service at-least temporarily.  I guess when it comes to learning lessons I have no choice but to learn the hard way.  I wanted to start doing routine maintenance on my bike so that I could learn more about the machine so yesterday I started with an oil change.  I made sure to make sure that I was doing everything properly and I first started with removing the oil drain plug and draining the old oil while the machine was still hot from my ride home from work.  Once all of the oil was out I removed the oil filter and let that drain for a moment or two as well.  I put the new filter on and was ready to add the fresh clean oil to the bike.  I picked up my manual and checked what the torque settings were for the oil drain bolt and it stated 16.5 ft-lbs.  I picked up my torque wrench that I bought from Amazon and set it to 15 ft-lbs and got started.  First I tightened the bolt with my hand and then used the torque wrench.  Before I could do anything on the first turn I felt the bolt get snug and then let loose.  I knew this was trouble as soon as it happened and I even knew what happened because I had read about it happening online.  I just stripped my oil pan.After looking around online for a replacement oil pan I have decided that $175 is just too much to pay for the part.  I called up a friend of my fiance and they are going to weld a nut to the inside of the oil pan so that the bolt will have something to grab onto.  This is the point where I say the project begins.  I started to look at the bike to see what route I would have to take in order to get the oil pan off and I am surprised it's not that difficult but you do have to remove some pieces before you can get to it.  In order to get the oil pan off the machine you actually have to remove the exhaust pipes from the engine and also have to remove your tail pipe.  The issue at hand here is that you are supposed to use a torque wrench again at 16.5 ft-lbs for the bolts that are holding the exhaust pipes to the engine block.  I fear that I may strip these if I use the same torque wrench again.  I will try with 10 ft-lbs to start with and see just how tight it seems I guess.  My first step however was going down to the auto parts store to pick up some penetration oil because the bolts holding the exhaust on seem be locked up tight and with it being made of aluminum I want to take no chances.Anyway I will try to post some pictures of the process once completed.
