The other day I woke-up rather early (5:30am) and went on with my day.  At around 9am I was thinking oh crap I remember reading an email this morning from a friend of mine that stated someone ran off on them without paying a bill for work that was completed.  After I searched my in-box and could not find the message I called my friend.  I found out that the guy did not do that.  It must have been a dream.

	I wonder what it means when I am dreaming about checking my email and actually thinking I saw something that never happened.  This is a first for me.
