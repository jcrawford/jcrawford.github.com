I was going through my E-Mail today and I read the following joke.> I have never understood why the sexual urge of men and women differ so  much...   FOR EXAMPLE: One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed.  The passion starts to heat up, when she eventually said "I don't feel  like it, I just want you to hold me."   I said "WHAT ? What was that?!"   So she says the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...  "You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for  me to satisfy your physical needs as a man." She then responded to my  puzzled look by saying, "Can't you just love me for who I am and not  for what I do in the bedroom?"Realizing that nothing was going to  happen that night, I went to sleep...   The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time  with her.  We went out to a good lunch and then went shopping at a  very big department store. I walked around with her while she tried on  several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which  one to take so I told her we'd just buy them all.  She wanted new  shoes to complement her new clothes, so I said "Let's get a pair for  each outfit".   We went onto the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of  diamond earrings. Let me tell you...she was so excited. She must have  thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.  I started to think she  was testing me because she then asked for a tennis bracelet when she  doesn't even know how to play tennis.I think I threw her when I said, "That's fine, honey." She was almost  nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.  Smiling with  excited anticipation she finally said, "I think this is all dear,  let's go to the cashier."   I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No honey, I don't  feel like it." Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped  with a baffled "WHAT?" I then said "Honey! I just want you to HOLD  this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial  needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.  " And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I  added, "Why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things  I buy you?"   Apparently I'm not having sex tonight either.This is just too much, I was laughing so hard I almost woke up my girlfriend.
