Once the AppStore opened on the Palm Pre I put my card in place so that I could order apps that I may want.  In the past I have had no problems while purchasing apps.  I have bought Tweed, Spot the missing pieces, JogStats, Air Hockey, Spot the Difference, and Conmigo. However while on the train this morning I decided to buy an app and as an end user it seemed like everything went smooth.  It asked for my palm password, asked if I wanted to purchase the app and then it downloaded the app.  Nothing out of the ordinary happened during the transaction, however when I got to the office this morning this is what I found in my in-box.

Transaction Failure Notice

Your previous transaction could not be processed. Please contact your financial institution should you have any questions.

You will still be able to purchase more applications in the Palm App Catalogue in the future. To do so, update the payment information in your account before placing a new order.

We appreciate your patience and hope you continue to enjoy using the Palm App Catalogue.

Best regards,Palm App Catalogue Team

It seems like Palm is allowing all transactions failed or not to actually download the app as if it were paid for…  Let’s hope they fix this problem real soon, I have already reported this to the palm app catalogue support team.

**** UPDATE ****On a side note Palm, I suggest that you look into other live chat applications for your website.  Using something that is Windows only is not very smart since there are a lot of Linux / Mac desktops out there now.  I had to load up Vista in a Virtual Machine just to contact your support reps.  At the very least provide an email address where your support staff can be contacted.  I searched for support and all I came up with was the Live Chat with your reps.
