title: "TeachMeCocoa.com: KVC and Bindings"
---
The other day Steven released another video on the TMC website.  This video is all about Key Value Coding and using Bindings in your interface.  I finally got the chance to watch the rest of the video this morning and I have to say that it is a great starting place if you are looking into bindings.  He goes into detail about KVC and explains how it all works.  I do wish however that he went into more details on the magic of Bindings and how they work behind the scenes.There are many developers (myself included) who have not yet adopted bindings because they see them as some magical functionality.  At some point I will have to read deeper about bindings and actually learn how they work so that I can use them properly in my project.  I do know how to implement a table view without using bindings and I have to say...  Bindings looks *much* easier to do.  It was a short process for getting the data into the table view in this video tutorial.  When doing all of this without bindings you need to have all the table view methods in place to return the proper data.This is another good release from TMC so be sure to check out the [KVC and Bindings](http://www.teachmecocoa.com/news/2009/03/14/kvc-and-bindings-video-tutorial/?referer=jcrawford) video tutorial if you want to start learning about KVC or Bindings
