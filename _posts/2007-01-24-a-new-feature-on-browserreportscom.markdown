Tonight BrowserReports.Com has launched a new feature.Â  It's actually pretty cool and is dubbed "spy" and for good reason.Â  It allows you to spy on the referrals as they are coming into the site.Â  Now it is not exactly "real time" because if we had it running every second it would be too intensive on the server.Â  It is running every 5 seconds with an auto reload using AJAX and JSON to deliver the data.You can take a look and watch the referrals come in, just head over to the [spy page](http://www.browserreports.com/spy "BrowserReports.COm Spy Page").
