For those of you out there who don't want to learn yet another language but still want to develop for the OS X platform you are in luck.  [Wez Furlong](http://netevil.org/) has been working on some code that will allow you to consume the frameworks that you can use with Objective-C.  With this bridge you can use PHP programming to develop applications.  This is a very neat accomplishment by Wez.  They have cooked up a small ping class with a GUI front-end.
  
  While it is still in the early stages you will most likely need a fair amount of C and Objective-C knowledge to make things work.  I look forward to seeing how this evolves as time goes on.  You can read more about this and see the example images on [Wez's post](http://netevil.org/blog/2007/11/php-objective-c-bridge).
