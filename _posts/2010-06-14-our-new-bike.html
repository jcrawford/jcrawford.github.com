Over the weekend we started out by looking for cars for my fiance Claire.  We wanted to get a second car because sharing a single vehicle can be a bit tough.  We looked at several dealerships and on <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> but we could not find anything for $3500 that we would really be satisfied with.  We decided to wait until tax season and at that time we would have a bit more money to buy a decent vehicle that will last a while.  Looking on <a href="http://www.craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> I spotted a very nice looking bike.  I looked at the details on the page and thought wow that is such a nice bike and you can't beat the price.

	We took a ride up to Windham NH to look at the bike which was at Revolution Cycles (603-893-9950?).  It was on a stand in the front window and when we walked in Claire was looking at it in awe.  It was in such nice condition and she asked me I wonder what the price is for the bike in the window....  I said that's the bike we came to see and she was shocked after seeing the bike that the price was only $3495.  The bike is very clean, and only has 3100 miles on it.  It is a 2006 but with the condition and the low miles it would usually go for around $4500-$5000.  Needless to say after starting it up and sitting on it I scooped it up.

	I plan to go take the MSF course that Massachusetts offers so that I can learn how to properly ride a bike but also skip the RMV tests.  So what do you think?
