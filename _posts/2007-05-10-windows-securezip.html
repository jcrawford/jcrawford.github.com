<img src="http://tinyurl.com/25zev6" />While I do not use Windows on a regular basis I do have XP installed under Parallels (trial mode) so that I can test websites in IE.  I decided that I would install <a href="http://www.securezip.com" title="SecureZIP - The next generation of ZIP">SecureZIP</a> - The next generation of ZIP.<a href="http://www.securezip.com"></a> I wanted to test it out and see what all of the fuss was about.  I have been hearing great things about this application.  SecureZip is a compression program that will actually encrypt your files based on either a pass phrase or a certificate.  Anyone who is worried about <a href="http://www.securezip.com" title="SecureZIP - The next generation of ZIP">data security</a> should look into this application.

	SecureZip also integrates with Outlook and while I cannot say that I tested this feature it does look very nice.  They state that you can encrypt attachments and then just resend the same files to another email address by forwarding the email and you will not have to re-encrypt or anything.  I believe that this application is overkill for the average computer user however for companies who deal with sensitive data (and run Windows) this just might be the solution they are looking for.

	From my tests the compression was not the greatest.  I just tested by compressing my Document and Users folder on the C drive which is 89MB and it compressed down to 62MB.  I also did my searching for a while to see if SecureZip had been cracked as of yet.  This search turned up empty.  It looks like it really is as secure as they are stating.  I am sure in the future we will see a crack for them however I am sure the developers would be quick to change the algorithm that they use so that any cracks released would be useless.

	They just need to make a mac version of this program now so they don't leave out the best users of all ;)
