You know if you wanted to travel from NYC to London you could do so in a plane and it would only take several hours.  The jokers over at Google Maps have a different idea for you.  Take a look at [this map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=New+York&daddr=London&layer=&sll=40.714167,-74.006389&sspn=0.09069,0.159302&ie=UTF8&z=4&om=1) which is a map with directions from NYC to London.  Be sure to look at #23 in the directions list.  Could you imagine? This is too funny!
