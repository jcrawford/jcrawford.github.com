title: The PHP Anthem
---
Someone with a very creative mind and musical talent has created an anthem for PHP.  You just have to hear this song, make sure you pay attention to the lyrics.My only question is what's with the girls they have nothing to do with PHP nor programming, I guess they just wanted them there for the eye candy.  Anyhow the lyrics to the song are pretty funny so let me know what you think.[youtube url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8zhmiS-1kw" autohide="0" hd="1" rel="0" showsearch="0"]<br />
