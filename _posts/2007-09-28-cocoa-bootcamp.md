title: Cocoa Bootcamp
---
Hi Everyone.  As you might have noticed I started up a Chip-In event at the top of my sidebar on the right.  I have been programming PHP for the last 7 years and recently made the switch to Mac OS X.  I am starting to get into development for OS X by reading books, getting help from others on IRC, etc.  I would love to attend the [Cocoa Bootcamp](http://bignerdranch.com/classes/cocoa.shtml) taught by none other than [Aaron Hillegass](http://www.bignerdranch.com/instructors/hillegass.shtml) however my budget will not allow for it.If I could take this course it would change the course of my career for the better.  I was thinking about trying to find an employer who would pay for the course while I signed a contract stating I would work for them for X years.  However I do not thing that will be possible.  I decided to give this a shot.  If I am unable to make enough money from this ALL proceeds from this WILL be put towards me attending the course.Even if you can only chip-in $1, it's welcomed by me ;)<!--more--><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://widget.chipin.com/widget/id/4211e42859d88ad0" allowscriptaccess="never" height="60" width="234" wmode="transparent" flashvars="color_scheme=blue"></embed>
