Over the last few weeks I have been doing a lot of reading about what makes a good photographer.  There is more than being able to know your cameras settings and taking a shot.  Two different photographers could shoot the same scene however one might compose the scene better than the other.  Using your creative eye to compose a scene which tells a story or shows creativity is not easy.  I have been trying to bring out my creative side and have been working on composing my scenes.  

	I am a member of a MeetUp group called Photography Workshops and while I have not yet attended an event I have been watching what has been going on.  I have been browsing the photos from other members and I am writing this post due to one photo that I saw that struck me.  I just love the creativity used in this shot and not many people would think to look for a shot like this.

	You can see the full resolution of this shot on the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Photoworks/photos/1291710/21825921/">Photography Workshops</a> MeetUp page.

	I just love how in the upper half of the glass you see the reflection upright and on the bottom half you see it upside down and in reverse compared to the top.  Excellent work accomplished by this photographer.  I can only hope that one day I am able to use my creative eye to this extent and capture shots like this.  As soon as I saw this image it quickly made it into the top 10 of my favorite photographs.
