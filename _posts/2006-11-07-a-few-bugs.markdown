There have been a few slight bugs in the new layout, please bear with us while we get them all ironed out.  We are also planning to make many more changes to this site in the future as we add custom features to the site.  Although I do not think I will be adding much more to the front page, it will really start to look cluttered if I do.  There may be a few bumps in the coming week or so but after that it should be back to normal.

We hope you enjoy the layout.
