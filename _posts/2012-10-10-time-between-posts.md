I want to start out by apologizing that I have not been posting that frequently and not really posting any content with meat.  Things will be changing soon and I will be updating this site more and more frequently.  I plan to continue writing about PHP but I also might start looking at Python and writing about that too.As mentioned above things are changing for me and it's for the better.  I will be departing my position at [Dailybreak](http://www.dailybreak.com/ "Dailybreak") this Friday and will be starting a new adventure with [Acronym Media](http://www.acronym.com/ "Acronym Media").  I love the team here at Dailybreak and I will be sad to leave, however I have to make some adjustments to my life so that I can be closer to my family.  The position at [Dailybreak](http://www.dailybreak.com/ "Dailybreak") does not allow for me to work remotely so I have to remain in the city 4+ hours away from my family.  It has always been in my interest to move back closer to my family and taking the position with [Acronym Media](http://www.acronym.com/ "Acronym Media") will allow for that as it is a remote position where I can work from home and visit the office every so often.This weekend I will be packing up the U-Haul and relocating to Adams, MA.  Since I will be closer to family and not driving 4+ hours each way every weekend I will have more time to dive in and learn even more advanced programming techniques and also to write about what I am learning to share with all of my readers.Stay tuned the updates should be more and more frequent once I get past the next week or two.
