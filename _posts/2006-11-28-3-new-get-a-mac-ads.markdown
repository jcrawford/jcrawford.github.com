Apple has released 3 new ad's under the Get A Mac campaign.Â  In my opinion they are not the best of the bunch, however they are still ok.Â  The first one is a gift exchange where Mac gives PC a picture book created in iPhoto and PC really wanted a C++ GUI book.Â  PC in turn gives mac the C++ GUI book.The second of the 3 ad's is probably the best in my opinion.Â  They open with the Hi i'm a Mac, however the pc says hi buy a pc rather than i'm a pc.Â  Trying to push the fact that PC needs people to buy more of them as the sales are dropping.Â  It's kind of funny in a geekish way.The third ad is where PC comes out looking like he just took on the kid in the movie Home Alone.Â  His hair is a wreck, he is worn out, all because he had to deal with 10 year old kid's who do not have checkbooks to balance.Watch the Ad's and enjoy.
