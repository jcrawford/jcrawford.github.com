title: gSpell For OS X (Google)
---
If you have been using OS X for any amount of time you will have noticed that the built in spell checker is not the greatest.  [Nathan Spindel](http://nspindel.com/) has created a plug-in for OS X that will allow you to use Google's spell checking system.  This is the same system that is used by GMail and Google Docs.  Since Google collects data from millions of users their spell checking engine is bound to be better than any desktop application.gSpell is a great addition to OS X I am glad that I have found it.Â  The best part is that it is an open source plug-in.Â  If you would like to give it a try [click here](http://nspindel.com/gspell/) to go to Nathan's website.
