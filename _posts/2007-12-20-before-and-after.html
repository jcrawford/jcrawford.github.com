<p><img class="floatleft" alt="Hair Before" src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/before.jpg" />For those of you who know me and see me on a day to day basis you were probably accustomed to seeing me with the long hair in the picture to the left.&nbsp; It all began when I found out that I was going to have my first son Liam.&nbsp; I decided that I was going to grow my hair until he had his first haircut.&nbsp; When the time came for Liam to have his first haircut my hair was not that long.&nbsp; I decided that I was going to continue growing my hair so that when it was long enough I could cut it and donate it.&nbsp; At first I was going to donate it to Locks of Love however not that long ago I was dating a girl in NY state who had a daughter with both forms of Leukemia that a child can get and one was the rarest form.&nbsp; The woman tried to get a wig for her daughter from Locks of Love but was turned down because they did not see this as a long term illness.&nbsp; I have also heard that each year they throw away hair that is not used, I am not sure how true that is.&nbsp; What I do know is that a child cancer patient was turned down for a wig.&nbsp; I have decided to donate my hair to Wigs for Kids because they will not turn down a child cancer patient.&nbsp; If you are curious what I look like please keep reading, I have posted a picture for you to see ;)<br />      &nbsp;</p>   <p>  </p>  <!--more-->  <p><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/after.jpg" alt="Hair After" class="floatleft" />I know that there are more people out there who could use the wig and not just children but I have been touched by the child and wish to donate to a children's cause.&nbsp; Today I felt my hair was long enough to donate and it was time to stop procrastinating and just get it over with.&nbsp; I went to the mall and had my hair chopped.&nbsp; I do not miss my long hair but what I have found myself doing already was trying to move my hair out of the way.&nbsp; When I was lying down before I always had to move my hair so that I was not lying on it, I would always move my head and pull my own hair.&nbsp; Tonight I tried to move hair that was not there.</p>  <p>So far everyone has liked my haircut and some did not even recognize me.&nbsp; I know I like it though, although I found myself feeling a bit colder today.&nbsp; What are your thoughts?&nbsp; Be honest :)&nbsp; </p>  <p>Maybe one day I will grow my hair out again and go through this process again.&nbsp; It is a good feeling knowing that you are able to help someone with a thing like this.&nbsp; Have any of you donated hair to a cause like this before?&nbsp; How many times?</p>  <p>If any of you work for Locks for Love please let me know if the rumor I heard about them throwing hair away is true.</p>
