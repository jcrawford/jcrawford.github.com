<p>The development team has increased the performance of Google Earth and have also made it possible to travel back in time.&nbsp; For instance you can take a look at San Francisco in 1946 to see what the city looked like back then.&nbsp; Do not expect high resolution quality images if you travel back in time.&nbsp; Google developers can do a lot but they cannot pull off miracles with photography that is years old.</p><p>This beta version looks very nice and is as easy to use as the previous version.</p>
