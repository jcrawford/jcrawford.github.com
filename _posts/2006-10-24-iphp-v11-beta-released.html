<p>I apologize to all those who downloaded iPHP v1.0 beta, there were a few issues keeping users from easilly installing the module.&nbsp; These issues have been fixed.I have also made it so that the url's used in iPHP now use www.php.net so that the appropriate mirror is choosen for the user.</p><p>You can download iPHP on my <a title="iPHP v1.1 beta" href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/php-irc-modules/iphp/">iPHP module page</a>. </p>
