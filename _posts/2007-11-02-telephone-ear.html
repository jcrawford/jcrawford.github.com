<p>I know at some point everyone has had the dreaded telephone ear.&nbsp; It's when you are on the phone for so long your ear starts to hurt.&nbsp; That happened to me today.&nbsp; I was on the phone for a whopping 3 hours and 35 minutes.&nbsp; When I got off the phone my ear was lost without the phone.<br />    </p>  <p>I don't think I have talked this much on the phone for about 7 years.&nbsp; Anyway it's time to let the ear get some rest ;)   </p>
