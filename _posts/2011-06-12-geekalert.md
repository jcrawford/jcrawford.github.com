---
I am always looking for ways to save money and learn about new products.  When I stumbled upon GeekAlert's [Apple Store promo code](http://www.geekalerts.com/apple-store-coupons/) section I quickly bookmarked the page, I also found they have a [ThinkGeek coupon](http://www.geekalerts.com/thinkgeek-coupon/).  Saving money is great but saving money on Apple Products is even better.  Now GeekAlert is not just a site which offers coupons and savings but they also provide news about the latest cool [new gadgets](http://www.geekalerts.com/), quirky gizmos, and geeky stuff.  It's a great site if you are crazy about all the new gadgets that come out on the market.  Looking through the site some of my favorite posts are the [Giant Beer Glass](http://www.geekalerts.com/giant-beer-glass/) which everyone should own. [Stainless Steel Drinkware](http://www.geekalerts.com/cold-maintaining-stainless-steel-drinkware/) is always a nice thing to have.  It just looks good and also keeps your drinks colder for a longer period of time.  <!--more-->How much fun would it be to take a shot from a  [Gummy Shot Glass](http://www.geekalerts.com/gummy-shot-glasses/) and then eat the glass for the chaser. I wonder how many people would try to stop you from eating what they think is glass.  Could you see the look on your friends face when you take a bite out of it and start chewing?  I could see this getting expensive if the glasses taste really good I would be getting a new shot glass with every round.  I wonder just how sweet they are?  Anyone actually tried them before?I will admit there is some hardcore geeky stuff on this site and though I am not a hardcore geek I found it interesting and fun to browse. So what are some of your favorite geeky posts?
