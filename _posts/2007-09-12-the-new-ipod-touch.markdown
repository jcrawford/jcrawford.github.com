With the release of the iPhone there was no longer a need for a stylus.  This was an amazing breakthrough on Apple's part.  Now the iPhone is a phone and an iPod rolled into one device.  What if you do not need the phone functionality?  Welcome the [iPod Touch](http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/ "iPod Touch").  It seems that the iPod Touch has all of the functionality from the iPhone that pertains to the iPod.You can browse your library with cover flow, play songs, podcasts, video's etc.  Probably the best part about the iPod Touch is that it has built in Wi-Fi so you can browse the net from anywhere that offers wireless access.The iPod Touch looks really appealing to me as I currently have a Nano.  I never got into the whole video in your hand craze.  I bought my Nano so that I could use it while running and track my progress with Nike+.  The Nano was the only iPod that could be used with the Nike+ running kit so my options when purchasing an iPod were slim.I was wondering if you could use the iPod Touch with the Nike+ running kit so I fired up my browser and went over to Apple's site to chat with a sales representative.  It turns out that those who use the Nike+ kit are still stuck with the nano.Apple choose to make the Nike+ kit only compatible with the Nano because they use flash drives and have no movable parts which make them ideal for running.  You can use any other iPod for running however it is not suggested and according to Apple it will not work with the Nike+ running kit.If anyone reading this has tested the Nike+ kit with the iPod Touch and was successful at getting it to work please let me know.  I know it's not ideal to run with the iPod Touch but I would like to have 1 iPod and have more functionality than that Nano supports.
