This morning I noticed about a 10-minute outage in my Internet service.&nbsp; I was wondering if the migration to Comcast had taken place.&nbsp; I quickly checked my hostname and in fact it was now a Comcast hostname.&nbsp; I was excited because my 6mbit account was supposed to be upgraded to an 8mbit account.&nbsp; I quickly went to Speakeasy and did a speed test, I was amazed to see that I was now downloading at 11666 kbits per second.&nbsp; For those of you who do not know much about how Internet speeds are calculated, that is about 1.4 Megabytes per second.&nbsp; This is about double the speed that I was at before.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed however when I found out that the upload speed would not be increased.&nbsp; I am still stuck at 768 kbits per second (96 KB/s).&nbsp; I work from home so the upload boost really would have helped.&nbsp; Uploads are slow when they are large files on this connection.&nbsp; I called in and talked to the business services to see if they offered anything faster than the residential.&nbsp; I was amazed to find out that the top business account was only 8mbit down with 1mbit up and was priced at $160 per month.&nbsp; Correct me if I am wrong but the only difference between my residential and the business account is in the upload speed.&nbsp; The top business account offers 232 kbits more upload than the residential.&nbsp; To me the padded features are not worth the extra cost difference when all I need is the increase in upload speed.&nbsp; I am paying about $100 less than that now for the residential.&nbsp; I asked the woman if they could bump me up on the residential and charge me extra as I do not need the email addresses, and other padded features that the business accounts get.&nbsp; She stated that there was no way they could do that.&nbsp; I hope she did not mean it was impossible but rather their billing system wouldn&rsquo;t allow for it yet.<br /><br />I love the download speed but they need to pump the upload speed about twice as fast as they currently have it set to.&nbsp; That would really make working from home comfortable.<br />
