<p>Google revealed Wednsday that it has had 50 times more requests come from the iPhone than any other mobile handset.&nbsp; When they first saw the figures they thought this can't be right and had the engineers parse the logs again.&nbsp; To their amazement it was correct.</p>  <p>This is nice to see as I plan on getting an iPhone in the future, I have just been waiting out all of the bugs to be found by those who could not wait to have the handset.&nbsp; I am also hoping that you will be able to use the handset on any carrier and not only AT &amp; T in the future.</p>  <p>I have seen and used the iPhone and must say that it is a great piece of hardware, very intuitive and works like a charm.&nbsp;</p>
