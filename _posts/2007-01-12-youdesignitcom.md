Today I was browsing the web to see what was new and cool out there.  I stumbled onto this site called [YouDesignIt](http://www.youdesignit.com).  It is a site that will allow you to design your own clothing.  Well...  Not design per se, but it allows you to choose a color for the shirt or hat and then use clip art to add a design to the shirt.  You can get your design either screen printed or embroidered.  The overall functionality of the site is nice, the Design Studio is pretty easy to use.  The Design Studio was first launched in Oct. 2006 so I am sure it is far from being a finished application.  The only drawback that I found on the Design Studio is that I could not find a way to upload my companies logo for use in the designs.  They do offer clip art so you might get lucky and be able to reproduce your logo.<!--more-->Not only can you use clip art but also you can choose the colors of the designs and also add text to your garment.  They don't stop with just allowing you to add text you can also choose which font to use, what color the text should be.  If the features I have mentioned so far are not enough you will be happy to hear that you can also control the spacing, curvature, alignment and depth of the text you are using. You can also control the depth and alignment of the images that you put on the shirt.The website has a very simple layout which is easy on the eyes and loads fast.  Within the Design Studio uses Adobe Flash for the front end, which makes it very slick and easy to use.  Now they have a nice site and a very slick tool for designing your own apparel, the prices must be outrageous right?  Wrong!  When it comes to pricing it is determined based on whether you are doing screen-printing or embroidered.  If you are doing screen-printing the amount of colors is taken into consideration.  If you are doing embroidered the color does not matter they base the price on how large the embroidery is and the stitch count.  As you can expect the cost will increase if you design both the front and back of the item.  As with most companies these guys follow the good old motto of he more you buy the cheaper the cost per item will be.When I checked the cost on 12 large polo shirts the total was $369.18 so each shirt was $30.76.  That is not bad since I had designed front and back using a colored shirt.  I was also using both text and clip art.  However the one thing I found to be odd was that when I clicked on the real time pricing it gave me a quote.  Not once during the design process did it ask me if I wanted it to be screen printed or embroidered.  At what stage do they ask this?  Are the prices calculated based on screen-printing by default and when you actually place the order you can optionally choose embroidered?Overall I would rate this site a 7 / 10.  It is a nice looking site that is easy to use, however it is still in development and has to overcome that final stretch.  They have a really nice concept for a business and I look forward to seeing what they implement into the system next.
