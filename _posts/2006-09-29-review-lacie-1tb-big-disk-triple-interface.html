<p>When I bought my PowerMac Quad G5 Apple computer, I was pricing the hard drives, it was quite expensive for 2 x 500gb drives to be configured, plus I wanted to find something that would be hot swapable.&nbsp; I took a look at the LaCie drives, I was really looking for a drive I could connect to my router and read from any computer on the network.&nbsp; Initially I was looking at the <a href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10645" title="LaCie Ethernet Disk 1TB" target="_blank">LaCie Ethernet Disk 1TB</a> however this is pretty much a computer in it's own.&nbsp; It has Windows XP embedded onto the drives and that is not something I wanted.&nbsp; I wanted to have a drive on the network that did not have ANY OS installed.&nbsp; LaCie did not offer a drive like that.</p><p>I ended up looking into the <a target="_blank" title="LaCie 1TB Big Disk" href="http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10128">1TB Big Disk</a> with a triple interface, it supported USB, FW400 and FW800.&nbsp; I purchased the drive and installed it immediately.&nbsp; I am happy with the drive for the most part, being that it is an external drive it does run a bit slow.&nbsp; When you first access the drive it takes a few moments to show the directories and files.&nbsp; I wish it was a bit faster however I have it connected via FW800 so there is no getting faster unless it was internal.&nbsp; The disk has been good for backing my items up however is it setup in RAID 1 so if one drive fails I will lose all the data stored on the drive.&nbsp; If you are looking for a good drive to use for backups and not just external storage I would not recommend this drive.&nbsp; Instead I would look for something setup in RAID 3 or 5.</p>
