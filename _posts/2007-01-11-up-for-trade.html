As some of you may know I recently made the switch from PC to Mac.  I am loving the Mac, the only drawback is that I need a laptop as well.  The prices on the laptops are out of my reach at the current time.  I have 2 fully loaded PC's here that I would be willing to sell/trade someone for an Apple laptop.  The specs are below.

<!--more-->
The First System:
<ul>
<li>AMD 64 3500+
<li>2GB RAM
<li>2 x 200 Western Digital SATA Hard Drives
<li>256MB Nvidia Video Card
<li>Thermaltake Xaser III Super Tower
<li>16x DVD +/- RW
</ul>

The Second System:
<ul>
<li>AMD 64 4400+ Dual Core
<li>2GB RAM
<li>2 x 250 Western Digital SATA Hard Drives
<li>256MB Nvidia Video Card
<li>16x DVD +/- RW
<li>Creative Labs Sound Blaster X-FI Platinum 7.1 sound card with remote and front panel inputs
</ul>

These systems have been sitting here collecting dust.  I no longer run windows nor do I wish to.  I guess I could throw linux on one but... Why?  OS X is built on BSD ;)

If anyone is interested I can provide more detailed specifications on ANY of the internal parts, I can even provide high quality pictures.  I built these machines myself I just do not remember all of the model numbers off the top of my head.
I would be willing to trade one or both of these for an Apple laptop (depending on condition and specs).  I am also a professional PHP Developer and could also work for the laptop if you run a website.

I have tried many things such as SwapThing and have had no luck finding anyone who has Apple laptops for trade.
