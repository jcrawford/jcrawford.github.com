Over the years I have been running this site and never even really had to think about WordPress or a development environment.  Lately I have been looking at plugin development and nothing I have been reading has even once mentioned a sandbox or development environment.  They all seem to state that if you activate a broken plug-in not to worry WordPress will disable it instantly.  This is all well and good however I have been used to a development environment at work, why not start one for my personal blog so that I can actually take the time to customize this site even more?

It's a great read and I will be checking out his suggestions in the near future.
