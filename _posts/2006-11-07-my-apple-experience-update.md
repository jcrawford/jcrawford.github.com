title: My Apple Experience Update

Re: One Bad Apple in the Bunch

I do apologize for not following up on this sooner.  I have been busy working on the site.  So the last I mentioned Apple replaced my display after repairing the first one 3 times and sending it back in worse condition each time.  When I received the display it had a few dead pixels (not too many) but the ones that were dead were right smack in the way.  I called Nate Doss (Apple Executive Team) and he told me that they could offer me a good will gesture from Apple for my experience.  He could replace the display again or he could give me a coupon for the online store that would get me $30 off from a $100 purchase.  I declined that.

The next day I called Nate again and told him that if he felt my experience was only worth a $30 coupon where I had to buy apple products to get the good will gesture then I did not want it.  After a bit he offered to replace my display or give me a free iSight.  I accepted the iSight because the new display that they sent me is covered under my apple care, so if I have more problems with it I can send it back in to get repaired.

I just hope that I do not EVER have to send it back in again, 3 times within 5 months is enough.  I do not want to go through this experience again it was horrible.  Anyhow if you go through things like this with Apple don’t back down.  They were clearly in the wrong and tried to get out of the situation without any loss.  I was really to the point where I was talking with an Attorney about the lack of competence the Apple Technicians had.  They solved the situation however I doubt I will ever buy another Apple display, I would go with Dell since they use the same LCD panels as Apple.
