title: The truth about Apple TV
---
Over the last few weeks people have been saying everything they can about the Apple TV.  There are a lot of people who are trashing the hardware stating that it will be DRM infested and that it will only play content which you purchased through the iTunes Store.  Yesterday I finally called Apple to get some more information about the unit before I would consider purchasing one.  What I found out was that it will in fact play content that is not purchased from the iTunes Store.All the time I have been spending encoding my home DVD's and importing them into iTunes has not been wasted.  They told me that if you can get it into iTunes you can play it on the Apple TV.  When I asked them about the hard drive they told me that it was there simply because you could sync it with your system just like you do the iPod.  You can choose what content is on the Apple TV and what is not.  That brought up this question in my mind. "What if I want to watch a movie that is not currently stored on the Apple TV, do I first have to remove something and wait for it to transfer over to the unit?"  The easy answer to that is no you do not.  In fact you do not even have to put anything on the Apple TV.  You can stream it from your computer to the Apple TV and it will use the hard drive as a buffer just as if you were watching a video on YouTube.<!--more-->I did not think to ask the question of well what if your Apple TV hard drive is full and there is no room for buffering, what would happen then?  I think I might just have to call them back and ask however I think the answer is pretty straight forward.  If there is no room to buffer either it will not work or it will be incredibly choppy as it tries to play faster than it can stream.  With almost all of my DVD's ripped and put into my iTunes collection I have over 180 GB of movies / TV shows.  It is a good thing it can stream, they did also tell me that if I was running wireless b/g I would have to wait a few moments for the movie to buffer but if I was running wireless N it would be almost instantaneous.The only thing that I do not like about the Apple TV is that it will not be easy to just upgrade the hard drive.  The drive will be formatted a certain way and will have a version of Front Row installed on the drive.  Unless someone hacks it and puts out an ISO image that you can put on another drive before throwing it into the Apple TV you are not going to be able to upgrade it.  The Apple associate first said that it was not user upgradable , that triggered the question of what about sending it into Apple for the upgrade.  It turns out you cannot do that either.I look forward to purchasing the Apple TV in the future and enhancing my media collection.
