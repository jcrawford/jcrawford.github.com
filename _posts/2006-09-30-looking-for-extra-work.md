title: Looking for Extra Work
---

Hey Everyone,

I am looking to pick up some extra work that can be done in the evenings and on Saturday's.  I need to come up with some extra cash to catch up on some bills.  You can see [My Resume](http://www.josephcrawford.com/my-resume/ "My Resume") and that contains all of the contact information that you need.  If you have or know anyone who is looking for an advanced PHP Developer I would appreciate it if you could contact me.
