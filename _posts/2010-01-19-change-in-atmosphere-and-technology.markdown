Most of you probably do not yet know but I have resigned from [Tatto Media](http://www.tattomedia.com/) and have moved back to [Namespace, Inc.](http://www.namespaceinc.com/).  While I am under a confidentiality agreement I cannot state what I was working on at [Tatto Media](http://www.tattomedia.com/) however what I can say is that I was working with the latest technologies such as [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org/), [JQuery](http://www.jquery.org/), CSS, etc to work on the products that [Tatto Media](http://www.tattomedia.com/) has to offer.  Since I have moved back to [Namespace Inc](http://www.namespaceinc.com/) I have been reading up on a completely new framework.  Most of you are probably thinking oh another PHP framework under your belt…  That’s not the case at all.  The new framework that we are using is a Java based framework called Wicket.

So far [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) seems to be a very nice web framework and Java is very appealing to me from a developers standpoint.  I guess the good part is that PHP is based on Java quite a bit so picking up the language has been rather easy.  I have also applied for an editor account on [Wicket by Example](http://www.wicketbyexample.com/) so you will find anything I write about [Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org/) on that site.  I may or may not publish the articles on this site as well I am just not sure yet.  Regardless I will post something here stating that a new example or article has been posted by me.
