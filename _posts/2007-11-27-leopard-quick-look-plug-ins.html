<p>In Leopard we all know that you can open a finder window, select a file or folder and hit the space bar to enable Quick Look to get a preview of the file.&nbsp; However by default if you have a folder selected it will show you an image of a folder.&nbsp; This is not very useful.&nbsp; I would like to see the contents of the folder when i enter Quick Look.&nbsp; This is where Quick Look plug-ins come into play.&nbsp; The developers over at Apple made Quick Look support an open architechture so that developers could create their own plug-ins to support more file types.</p>  <p>Taiyo (a Japanese developer) has written 2 such plug-ins.&nbsp; They are both really useful.&nbsp; The <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t_trace/20071124/p3">Folder Quick Look Plug-in</a> will allow you to view the contents of a folder, I think Apple should have had this as the default behavior.&nbsp; The <a href="http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t_trace/20071125/p2">Zip Quick Look Plug-in</a> will allow you to see what files are contained in the zip file that you selected.&nbsp; Very handy if you do not want to extract something when you are not sure if it is the correct archive.&nbsp; All you have to do is download the zip files and place the *.qlgenerator files in the /Library/QuickLook/ folder and they should work automatically.</p>
