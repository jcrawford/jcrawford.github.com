Today I noticed that MySpace has released a new uploader for pictures.  I actually like it a lot better since you can upload muliple photo's at one time rather than uploading them one by one.  Now if only the messenger they have did not require Internet Explorer.  It would be nice to be able to use that on the Mac either in Safari or FireFox.  All I can do is hope that they release something soon :)
