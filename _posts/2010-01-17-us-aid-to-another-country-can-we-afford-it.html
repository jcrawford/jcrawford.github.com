If you know me and are reading this then you know that I am not racist or anything like that. My sympathies go out to all of the families and victims in Haiti. Now that I have said that I also want to state that my thoughts and feelings are in no way associated with Haiti.

	The things I do not understand is when we go to war and bomb a country we spend a ton of money building back the city we destroyed. Why does America take on this financial position when we are already so far in debt to China? Why are we providing aid to other countries when things like earthquakes, tsunami’s etc take place? I am not saying that we should not be helping but where is all of this money coming from? Are we going further and further into debt doing this? Is the US getting aid from other countries when things like this happen? What are the odds that China will buy more of our debt or that the debt will just go away?

	Isn’t it time to get our country out of debt before we go deeper and deeper into debt?

	Again none of this is directed at the latest act of god but really how are we ever going to get out of debt?
