One of my old friends from high school posted something on myspace which I just had to post here.  It's called Redneck Bungee and boy I would love to do this.  I have done the human slingshot. This is where you sit in a chair similar to a chairlift you would see at a ski resort and it has 2 bungee's connected to it.  The bungee's are stretched about 150 feet to the top of 2 towers.  Once they are fully stretched it releases you and sends you soaring to 220 feet in the air.  The chair doesnt stay upright, it flips and flops and it was a hell of a time.What you will find below just looks like it would be awesome for any thrill seeker, maybe I will have to make one of these things and test it out.  Any takers?<!--more--><object height="350" width="425"><param value="http://embed.break.com/MjA4ODA2" name="movie" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" saveembedtags="true" enablehref="false" allownetworking="internal" enablejsurl="false" width="425" src="http://embed.break.com/MjA4ODA2" allowscriptaccess="never"></embed></object>
