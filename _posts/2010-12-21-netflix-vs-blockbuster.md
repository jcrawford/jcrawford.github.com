[![Netflix](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/netflix-logo-300x133.jpg "Netflix")](http://www.netflix.com/)Over the past few years I havebeen happy with the service that Netflix offered. I was paying$16.99/mo and was able to have out 3 DVD's or Blu-Ray disks at atime. It was not until last month that I even thought of usinganother service. For the last year while subscribing to Netflix Iwas tempted to also subscribe to <ahref="http://www.gamefly.com/">GameFly because my kidsand I love to play video games. I held off due to the fact that Iwould have two bills to pay every month just to feed ourentertainment needs. While using Netflix I had very few issues,sure there was the occasional movie(s) lost in the mail while onthe way to me but it did not happen that often. In-fact I think Ionly had to report 2 items as never received.<!--more-->Last month I received an email from Netflix stating thatthe package I was in was going to go through a price increase. Theywere increasing my price from $16.99 per month to $19.99 per month.While this is only a $3.00 per month increase I started to look forother alternative services. That's when I found that for the same$19.99 per month I could use Blockbusters mail service. Initially Ithought wow they are the same price, why would anyone make theswitch. I then noticed that all video games for every platform werealso included in the plan that Blockbuster offers. This was awin-win situation for me and I quickly made the switch. <ahref="http://www.blockbuster.com/"><imgsrc="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/blockbuster-logo-o.jpg"alt="Blockbuster" title="Blockbuster" width="175" height="107"class="floatleft" />So you may be wondering what myexperience has been with Blockbuster so far. Well it did not startoff too well as the first 3 movies that were sent to me neverarrived. I quickly went into my queue and reported them as notbeing received and Blockbuster immediately sent me another copy ofeach DVD that was not received. With Blockbuster you also have theoption to return 5 of your mail rentals to a store and exchangethem at no cost. I liked this option because it could take 3 daysto return a DVD and receive the next. The one fall-back to this isexchanging for video games. I guess if you return any mail itemwhether it be a movie or a game and try to rent an in-store gamethey actually charge you around $5 for the rental. In my opinionthey should not be charging for in-store games because the onlinegames are included. I should be able to return 5 mail items for anymovie or game in any Blockbuster store, however that is not thecase yet. I have only been exchanging in-store for movies since Irefuse to pay for the game, in this case I will wait for the itemto be mailed. Now in the past I have had on 3 different occasionsissues with returning rentals to the store. I would drop the movieoff in the drop box and then a week later have Blockbuster emailingme or calling me asking when I was going to return the item. On 3different occurrences they tried to charge me for these so called"missing" movies. I am not sure how they are missing when I droppedthem into a slot which put them in their store. Up until I signedup for the online account I had given up on Blockbuster. Have youhad an experience with any of the above mentioned companies? Pleaselet me know if it was good or bad in the comments below. The only issue i seem to be having with the Blockbuster rentals is the factthat the paper packaging is much smaller than the Netflixofferings. While smaller packaging may be good for some people itis not for me. At out apartment we have mailboxes that are mountedon the wall of the building and with the Netflix rentals i couldfold it over the edge of the mailbox and close the lid. This wouldreveal to the postmaster that i had some mail to go out and theywould take them. They seem to never see the Blockbuster rentals inmy box so i constantly have to make trips to the store to returnthem.
