title: Zend PHP 5 Certification
---

So are you getting prepared to take the new PHP 5 Certification Exam offered by Zend?  I have yet to see any books released for the preparation like i did with the PHP 4 exam, however there is something new and very cool.  php|architect offers a Mock Tesing Environment which is powered by Vulcan Web Testing System.  It is a Java based system that is very nice and easy to use.  The mock exam is comparable to the Zend Exam because it will give you a 90 minute window to complete the exam, the same as Zend.  The questions are not the same as the one's on the Zend exam however they have made the Mock Exam a bit more difficult than the Zend Exam.  If you score well on the Mock Exam you are ready to take the Zend Exam.  I have purchased a 5 slot exam so that i could write this review.  I must say that the questions on the Mock Exam are directly related to PHP 5 and the new features such as PDO and SimpleXML.  If you plan to cram for the exam do not just focus on the internals of PHP but also study the most popular extensions as well.  PDO, SimpleXML, MySQLi, SPL, etc.

I would highly suggest that you take the Mock Exam before you go to take the real one ;)  You can purchase the exam from php|architect in a single exam, 5-slot or 10-slot exams.  If you have taken the Mock Exam let me know what your thoughts are.  I firmly believe that it is well put together and will be a successful for helping people prepare for the new exam offered by Zend.
