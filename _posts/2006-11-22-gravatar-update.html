<p>I was finally able to get my comments to accept the paging capability of a plugin that I found.&nbsp; I put the <a title="Gravatar" href="http://www.gravatar.com/">gravatar.com</a> code back in place after limiting the comments to 10 per page.&nbsp; It seems Gravatar is still having some issues.&nbsp; The pages would load slow and that is not something I want to have happen on my site.&nbsp; I have once again disabled the gravatar code until they fix the issues they are having.&nbsp; I am looking forward to Gravatar 2.0 and hope they get the issues fixed soon.&nbsp;</p>
