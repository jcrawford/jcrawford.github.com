Every now and again I will walk into a store to purchase the products that I need.  I make my way up to the register and I am told about some rewards program that the store offers.  If you spend X dollars per quarter you can get up to 2.5% cash back in the form of a rebate check.  Would you be interested? They ask.  Generally these programs appeal to me however there are so many stores out there that it is hard to remember what store you have a rewards program for.  You also have to carry around the rewards cards with the barcode on them either in your wallet or on your keychain.

If you have ever had to deal with any of these programs (or multiple) you will know that they can be hard to keep track of.  This is where we welcome <a href="http://www.fatwallet.com">FatWallet.Com</a>.  This website has a ton of online merchants who all offer different amounts of cash back for you buying products from their site.  While browsing the site I saw some that were 1.0% all the way up to 12.0%.  Think about it, it might not seem like a lot but over time it can add up.  At 12% for every $100 you spend you will get $12 back.  That is a good deal if you ask me.

<!--more-->So how does all of this work?  You go to FatWallet.Com and setup an account.  You browse the list of vendors that they have (looks like a few thousand) and go to the site you wish to buy a product from.  If you are not logged in it will prompt you to do so.  Once you go to the site a popup window will notify you that you are now tracking rewards.  When you make a purchase the store will notify FatWallet about the purchase.  You will then have a cash back transaction in your FatWallet account that will be marked pending.  They state that most merchants will report a transaction to them within a few days however the merchants have up to 3 weeks (from the shipping date) to report it.  After they report it the transaction will be held in a pending state for 90 - 121 days.  This will allow the merchant sufficient time to process any returns.  After the pending period the transaction will be marked complete and you will be able to withdraw the funds.

Most places that are like this would generally send you a check (as long as the amount is greater than $10) however with this site you can request a check or payment via Paypal.  I think it's cool that they offer Paypal for the users.  No more waiting for checks to be printed and mailed.

One thing I would like to see is an automated system for this.  From what I can tell it all looks very manual.  The merchant manually notifies FatWallet about the purchase, return, etc.  It would be cool if FatWallet offered a SOAP web service for websites to consume that would alert them upon order processing/shipping/return.  This is possible but it would require all of the merchants to incorporate some code into their site.  At least with using a SOAP web service any programming language could consume the service.

I will be testing out FatWallet.Com with my next online purchase, but with vendors like Apple, Barnes & Noble, 1800Flowers who wouldnâ€™t try this.
