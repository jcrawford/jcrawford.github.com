<p>So as you may have read previously I was going to check out a few different methods of advertising on the site.&nbsp; Determine which method would give the best return and also not be intrusive to the viewers.&nbsp; I tried Google AdSense and found that to be too intrusive.&nbsp; The good thing about AdSense is that it is integrated with Google Analytics which is a very nice statistics tool.&nbsp; In the future I may give AdSense a try again if I can figure out how to make it look less intrusive with my layout.</p><p>After I gave up on AdSense I tried Kontera which is an in-text method.&nbsp; You place a small bit of javascript before your &lt;body&gt; tag and it will link certain terms in your text.&nbsp; It would also show more information when the visotor hovers over the links.&nbsp; The only issue i have found with this is that it does not have a very good return.&nbsp; I think visitors may find it a bit intrusive when they move the mouse around the screen to have all of these info boxes popping up.</p><p>I also found that when using IE 6 the links are messed up, they appear out of place.&nbsp; I am going to leave Kontera in place for now but once the site gets listed in Google I think I will give Text Link Ad's a try.&nbsp; TLA is not intrusive to the user at all and from what i can see will increase page rank and visitors very well.&nbsp; I have started the testing for TLA by buying 6 ad's for my site.&nbsp; So far though I have not seen many visitors come to the site from any of the TLA's that I purchased which makes me a bit weary about the idea.</p>
