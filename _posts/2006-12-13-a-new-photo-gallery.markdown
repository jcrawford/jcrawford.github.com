I have started to setup a photo gallery that uses Flickr for the photo hosting and allows them to be viewed here on my site.  Jump over to the [Photo Gallery](http://www.josephcrawford.com/photos/) to see pictures of the kids and the rest of the family.

I am using a plugin for now however in the near future i will either hack this plugin to offer more functionality on my site or write one from scratch.
