Today I was browsing around YouTube and I came across this video.  I will warn you it has some strong language and sexual reference.  If you are offended by that do not watch this video.  I personally found this to be very humerus and enjoyable.

I espacially like the Finder song and the ending apologies lol, what do you think?Â  The author of this video is very talented and I would love to see more of their work.
