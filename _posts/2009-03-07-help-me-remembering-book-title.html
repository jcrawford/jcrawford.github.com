I went to B&N last night trying to find this book to read to my step son.  I did not have any luck trying to find the book because I do not know the title.

What I do remember about the book is that it was written in a journal format (boy's diary) the boy's father was a truck driver and not around much.  The boy had problems at school with kids taking his lunch from his lunch box so he decided to make a lunchbox alarm and I believe he also used it as a door alarm.

I wish I could remember the name of this book so that I could pick up a copy.  I remember reading it when I was about 8 years old so that was about 20 years ago.  I read it around the time that I read pippi long stocking, and the ramona books by beverly cleary and the indian in the cupboard.

If anyone knows the title of the book please let me know.  For now I have picked up the Indian in the Cupboard.
