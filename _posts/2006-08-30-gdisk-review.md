[gDisk](http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/ "gDisk") is an application that will allow you to use your [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com/ "GMail") account as a storage disk.  It will allow you to store files in your [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com/ "GMail") account and make it work as if it is an external disk drive.

I stumbled accross [gDisk](http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/ "gDisk") the other day, i knew applications like this existed for Windows but i had not seen anything for the Mac.  I have been using [gDisk](http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/ "gDisk") and it seems pretty decent.  It is obvious that it still needs work.  There are a few issues that i came accross.
<!--more-->
A few of the issues i found are as follows.  When you first start the program it will notice that there are no Labels, it will in turn ask you is you wish to have it create the default labels.  On my system when i choose yes, it looked as if it was creating the labels, but then just prompted me with that dialog again.  Every time i hit yes it would continuously prompt me with the dialog.  Finally i hit No and created the labels myself.  Once you create labels, you can drag and drop files from finder to labels.  The issue i found with this is that if you drag say 5 files, about 1-2 are uploaded and the rest remain in the upload queue.  I did not see a way to remove the entries from the upload queue so i had to restart the program.

The next thing is not really an issue just an opinion i have.  Currently when you upload a file it marks the item as a Draft and it is store in the Drafts folder.  Why is it doing this?  The other apps i have used previously on WIndows would mark the message as read and archive it into the All Mail folder.  This put's it out of sight and out of mind when you are in [GMail](http://www.gmail.com/ "GMail").

The final issue (which is not that big of a deal for someone who knows) is that [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com/ "GMail") allows for a maximum filesize of 10MB, i attempted to upload a 17MB file.  The upload process continued on, once done it removed it from the queue however it never notified me that the file was too large or that there was an error in any way.  I think that this should check the filesize locally before uploading the file because we dont have time to waste waiting for it to upload just to find out it's too big.

If these issues are fixed i think [gDisk](http://gdisk.sourceforge.net/ "gDisk") will become an everyday app that i will be using.  Right now however i cannot use it due to the issues.
