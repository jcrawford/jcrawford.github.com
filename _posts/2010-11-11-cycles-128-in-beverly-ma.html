A few weeks ago I thought I heard a clunking in the front end of my Katana and I needed to get an oil change anyway so I took the bike to Cycles 128 in Beverly, MA.  I know that Cycles 128 is owned by the same family that owns Greater Boston Motor Sports, Plaistow Power Sports and Parkway Cycles. I have had bad customer service at Greater Boston Motor Sports and Parkway Cycles so I guess I should have known.  You can read about my <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/2010/07/12/riding-gear-service/">GBM Experience</a> but I have never posted the issue I had with Parkway.

	That issue was with ordering some parts I was told they would be there on a certain day (Monday) and when that day came they said oh they will be here on Friday.  They blatantly lied to me as they reassured that all parts were coming from the East Coast.  Come to find out it took till Friday because 1 part came from the West Coast.

	Anyway I took the bike in for the routine maintenance and when they were done they told me that they had turned my suspension settings on the handlebars all the way up.  They said that it was turned all the way down and that is probably the cause of the clunk when I hit a bump or pot hole the forks were just bottoming out.  The part that I find concerning is that they said the 2006 Katana's should have 10 clicks for each of the adjusters and mine only had 4.  They said that someone may have been trying to replace the seals and never re-assembled it properly so I only have 4 clicks on each.  I asked them what it would cost to have that fixed and they said a few hundred dollars.  I opted to pass on that at the time since it was not a safety concern.

	I went home and started <a href="http://katriders.com/vb/showthread.php?t=113659">this thread</a> (sorry you will have to register as a member to view the thread) on <a href="http://katriders.com/">katriders.com</a>.  I took the advise of one of the board members and made direct contact with TMod who is some sort of resident expert on Katana's.  As you can see the TEN the mechanic was referring to does not actually mean 10 positions rather it stands for TENSION which is another way to say rebound.

	I guess I will not bring this bike back to any dealerships that this family owns because they obviously are not competent enough for me to trust my life in their hands, they just want my money and will find any reason to get at it.  I am guessing if I had told them to do the service they would have just parked the bike in a corner for a few hours and then called me back saying it was done.  I was warned by a friend that these shops try to find reasons to have you return with your bike but I brushed it off, guess I better listen to people more often.
