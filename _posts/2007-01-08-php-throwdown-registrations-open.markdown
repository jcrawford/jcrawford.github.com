Back in October I mentioned a new PHP contest called PHP Throwdown that would be coming out.  They announced today that Registrations are open so run on over and [signup](http://phpthrowdown.com/?page_id=6) to be a contestant :)I personally will not have any time to register for this contest which saddens me because it really looks cool.  Maybe I will get in on the next one they hold.  Good luck to all of you who do register.
