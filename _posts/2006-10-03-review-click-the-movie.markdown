Recently i saw the movie Click, if you have not seen this movie you need to.  It's the new movie with Adam Sandler where he works all the time to make ends meet.  He winds up aquiring a universal remote control that controls more than he wanted.  The remote actually controls his life, he can mute people, fast forward, go on auto pilot etc.  This movie really hit me, I tend to work more than i should and i miss out on quite a bit with my family.  If you are a workaholic you should watch this move, maybe it will make you slow down on your career :)

I do not want to miss out on anything with my family and this movie has made me re-think some things.  Yet another blockbuster hit from Happy Maddison Productions and i look forward to seeing what they come up with next.
