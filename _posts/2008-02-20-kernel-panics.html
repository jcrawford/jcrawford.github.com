<p>Over the last few days I have had several kernel panics on OS X 10.5.2.&nbsp; The only thing that has changed since this all started happening was a new job.&nbsp; I have been working from home using the Cisco client for the first few days and all was going well.&nbsp; I found it tedious to continuously enter my password into the Cisco client and it was recommended that I use a utility called <a href="http://www.nexumoja.org/projects/Shimo/" title="Shimo">Shimo</a> which is a more feature rich front end for the Cisco backend.</p>  <p>All of these kernel panics started happening shortly after I started to use Shimo, I am wondering if it could be the cause?&nbsp; Have any of you readers had this issue?&nbsp; It seems to only happen sometimes and not every time I connect or disconnect.&nbsp; It even happens after I have been connected for a while.&nbsp; I think I will have to discontinue use of Shimo and go back to the Cisco client.&nbsp; If this solves the kernel panics I will be sure to let you know.&nbsp;</p>
