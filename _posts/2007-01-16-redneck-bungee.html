One of my old friends from high school posted something on myspace which I just had to post here.  It's called Redneck Bungee and boy I would love to do this.  I have done the human slingshot. This is where you sit in a chair similar to a chairlift you would see at a ski resort and it has 2 bungee's connected to it.  The bungee's are stretched about 150 feet to the top of 2 towers.  Once they are fully stretched it releases you and sends you soaring to 220 feet in the air.  The chair doesnt stay upright, it flips and flops and it was a hell of a time.

What you will find below just looks like it would be awesome for any thrill seeker, maybe I will have to make one of these things and test it out.  Any takers?
