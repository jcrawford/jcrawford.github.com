Well it was not as bad as I anticipated.  I will be out for a few days but right now I am feeling ok.  It's probably because my jaw is still numb from whatever it is that they used.  I will tell you it is messy, you bleed a lot and well it's just not fun.I am not looking forward to drinking my foods but that is what I have to do.  Tomato Soup, Pudding, Yogurt, Scrambled Eggs, etc. are about all I can eat.  I WANT THE PRIME RIB!Oh not to mention they said no smoking for 10 days, you're kidding right :)  That is the only rule they have given me that I will not follow, I know it can lead to dry socket but I am only having a couple a day as opposed to the pack I am used to.  Anyway I hope to be better by Wednsday, we'll see.
