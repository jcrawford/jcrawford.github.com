<p>If you are in need of a PHP Developer / Website Design, feel free to contact me if you run an online store.&nbsp; We can always barter if your cash flow is low.&nbsp; I have been willing to in the past and I am willing to now.&nbsp; Ofcourse the product has to be of interest, if you try to trade dog food it just won't work ;)</p><p>As always the first time we deal with eachother the code will be completed first and put live on my servers.&nbsp; Once approved by you i will push it to your servers in exchange for the products we bartered for.</p><p>You may be asking yourself is this guy serious?&nbsp; Yes very.&nbsp; I have a day job which pays the bills, etc.&nbsp; If i can barter for products / services that I would normally use, why not?&nbsp; It saves me from having to buy them with my paycheck.</p><p>Maybe you are saying, he probably just jacks the rates up even higher than normal just to get more for his time.&nbsp; You are incorrect if that is how you are thinking.&nbsp; I actually lower my rates a bit because I feel more people should be bartering (and i dont have to pay taxes when we barter).&nbsp; Ofcourse each side has to get something they deem valuable for what they are trading ;)</p><p>Currently i am interested in Apple products, however dont be afraid to contact me if you do not have any Apple products, there is more to life than Apple.&nbsp; Did I just say that?&nbsp;</p><p>Contacting me will cost nothing, why not atleast talk about it?&nbsp; Fill out <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/contact-me/" title="Contact Form" target="_self">this simple form</a> and i will get back to you.</p>
