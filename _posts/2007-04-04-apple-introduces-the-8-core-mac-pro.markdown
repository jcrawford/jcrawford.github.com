If you have been keeping up with things when it comes to Apple products you might have expected this was coming.  The new 8-core system takes advantage of 2 quad core Xeons which are named "Clovertown".  This is going to be a real monster of a machine.  I currently have the quad-core 2.66 gHz Mac Pro with 4gb of ram and I am quite content.As you can imagine the base price increases by about $1500 when you customize to the new 8-core system.  The base price for a quad 2.66 is $2499, now if you jump that to the 2 quad core chips you are looking at a price tag of $3997 just for the base system.  If you want to add more ram well the cost will increase.I think that is still quite expensive and will wait several months to watch the price fall a little bit.  It does make you wonder though if you can just throw a few Clovertown chips into a current Mac Pro which has the 2.66 dual cores.  I know I have seen it done online but it brings up the question of whether or not there is different hardware in the 8-core system.  Did Apple have to add or change anything to make it run 100% smooth with the quad core processors?
