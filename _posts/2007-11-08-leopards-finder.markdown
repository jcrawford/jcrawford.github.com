![Finder](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/finder.png)As most all of you probably know with the release of Leopard the Finder has been updated quite a bit.  There is now support for quick view, cover flow.  I love the features that the quick view brings to you.  Cover flow is equally nice but I think it needs a bit of work.  I have all of my movies in iTunes so they look good.  They all have nice covers so that when flipping through them I can easily tell the movie by the cover art.
  
I know that the cover art is managed by iTunes and not stored in the actual mpeg file, so when browsing the directory with Finder with cover flow enabled none of the cover art shows.  It just shows the first frame of the movie.  It would be nice if cover flow somehow knew about these files and artwork connected with them.
  
I do love the fact that you can move your mouse over any of the movies and play it right there in Finder in a thumbnail view.  I guess with the cover art this would not be possible unless they made the cover art vanish when you clicked the play button. Notice in the image above I am playing 50 First Dates and there is a small stop icon in the middle of the video, this is because I have the mouse over the movie.  You can also click the eye icon in the top of the Finder to make the quick view show a much larger view of the movie while it is playing.
