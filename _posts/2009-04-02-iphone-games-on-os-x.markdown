One thing I have never understood is the fact that there is a huge lack of games out there for OS X.  Even the small games like [Tetris](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284800458&mt=8), [Trism](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=284653044&mt=8), [Fastlane](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=296234012&mt=8), are great games but where is the OS X version?  I know that you will lose all of the accelerometer features but you could still have nice keyboard commands.  I wonder just how hard it would be to port these games over to OS X.  I wonder if this will ever happen?  I know there are a handful of games and even less gamers on the mac but some of these nice small games would be good for me to put on the laptop for the kids to play.I remember back in the day (4th &#8211; 5th grade) I would play &#8220;[Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_in_the_World_Is_Carmen_Sandiego%3F)&#8221; and &#8220;[The Oregon Trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(computer_game))&#8221; and used to love these games.  Trying to find something like that for kids today on OS X seems to be almost impossible.  I did find one game that I know the kids will like and that is [Wall-E](http://www.apple.com/games/articles/2008/06/walle/).  What happened to all the small games for kids though?
