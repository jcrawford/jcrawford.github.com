<p>After watching a CNN video that TUAW linked to, I had to post it here.&nbsp; It is pretty funny.&nbsp; They start out talking about the features of the Zune, what it can and cannot do.&nbsp; In the end they start comparing it to the new Shuffle.&nbsp; The best part is when they say why can't Microsoft get any good designers for their product :)</p><p>You can read the entire story and watch the video by visiting going to the <a title="Found Footage: Zune upstaged by a Shuffle" href="http://www.tuaw.com/2006/11/14/found-footage-zune-upstaged-by-a-shuffle/">TUAW post</a>.</p>
