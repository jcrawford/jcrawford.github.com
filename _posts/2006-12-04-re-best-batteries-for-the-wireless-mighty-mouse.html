<p>In my previous post I was in search of the best batteries to use with the Wireless Mighty Mouse, I think I found some that will work great.  After charging the Radio Shack 2200-mAh batteries the most I could get out of them were 4 bars in the system preferences panel.  They also died really quickly (within a few days).  Last night I went to K-Mart and I picked up some Energizer batteries that are 2500-mAh.  I am waiting for these to take on a full charge (I forgot to plug them in last night) but on only a few hours they are showing 4 bars.  I am hoping that these batteries will hit the 5 bar mark and actually last more than just a few days.</p>

<p>I am not sure why the 2200-mAh batteries would show no more than 4 bars in system preferences, maybe they have the mouse reporting the mAh of the batteries as they start to die and system preferences is programmed to work best with Lithium.  I am not sure what the differences are between the batteries.  All I know is which is working best for me.</p>

<p>I am going to let the Energizer batteries take on a full charge and then use them until they are in need of a recharge.  Once that happens I will update you guys on how long they lasted.</p>
