Recently I signed up for <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g" title="Pay Per Post">PayPerPost.com</a> which allows me to post about sponsored content and be paid for a post on my site.  I have opted to take this route rather than throwing advertisements on my site and forcing you to look at them.  If I make a post on my site and you do not want to see it, you just don't read it. If you would like to advertise across blogs and have people review your products or services you might want to look into <a href="http://payperpost.com/page/advertiser">blog ads</a>. If you are not aware of what <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g" title="Pay Per Post">PayPerPost</a> is, you should take a look.  You can get paid for writing content about sponsors.  You do not have to post anything you choose what you want to write about and what you do not.  The prices for the opportunities range from $5 - $1000.  Obviously the really big one's will require you to have a PR of 7+ however work your way up the ladder.  You can currently take 3 opportunities per day so if you get 3 $10 opportunities per day you are looking at $900 per month in income.

PayPerPost has a new program called ReviewMyPost and if you click on the title of any post on this site you will see a link for ReviewMyPost.  It is another method that I can make money and YOU can make money as well.  All you have to do is click one of the links, review my post (on your blog) and you will be paid as well.  You might be asking what you will be paid to review a post on my site.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g" title="Pay Per Post">PayPerPost</a> will pay you $7.50 to review any of the posts on my site even if they are not sponsored content.  They will also add $7.50 to my account.

This program is great, it will allow you to review other people's posts and get paid to pretty much link to others on the net.  Once you are a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g" title="Pay Per Post">PayPerPost</a> member you can add these badges to all of your posts and you too will be able to get paid when someone reviews one of your posts.  I also see this as a great way to help your Google PR because you are going to get a ton of links to your site.  This program also makes it possible for people to make money even if they do not wish to place sponsored content on their website.

I love this program PPP let's keep up the good work, I look forward to seeing what you offer in the future.
