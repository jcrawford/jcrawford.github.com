<p>Today someone posted a link on an IRC channel and ofcourse I had to check it out.&nbsp; Now I love my Mac and do not regret the switch.&nbsp; The one thing Apple has going is a good marketing campaign with the new Get A Mac commercials.&nbsp; Some like them and some dont.&nbsp; I personally love them.&nbsp; Besides being true they are also humerous.</p><p>Someone decided to spend some time and write a few spoof sketches for the Get A Mac commercials.&nbsp; Among them is my favorite Performance.&nbsp; I almost lost it while watching these.&nbsp; My only question is why they are being so rough on linux?&nbsp; It is a good OS, it is becoming more and more poular as a desktop, i find it to be a lot faster and more stable than windows.</p><p>The one point that they bring up is that you cannot play many games on the Mac, I think you will see that change in the near future with the migration to the Intel processors.&nbsp; However if it doesn't change just dont get a Mac ;)&nbsp; Mac users do not buy them for their gaming ability, they buy them for performance and stability, oh and that sexy look of OS X.</p><p>You can see them on <a href="http://tv.truenuff.com/mac/" title="Get A Mac Spoofs" target="_blank">TruNuff TV!</a>&nbsp;</p>
