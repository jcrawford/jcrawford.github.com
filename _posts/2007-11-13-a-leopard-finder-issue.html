<p>I have been dealing with the most annoying issue I have found in Leopard's Finder yet.&nbsp; The issue has to do with a directory not refreshing when open.&nbsp; When I used Tiger I could have a Finder window open, save a file to the directory and the Finder window would update.&nbsp; In Leopard however if I download a file to a directory which I have a Finder window open for the file does not show.&nbsp; I either have to close that Finder window and navigate back to the directory or I have to go up one level in the directory structure and re-open that directory.&nbsp; I have also noticed that the directory contents will refresh if you delete a file.&nbsp; I am not sure if it would work with renaming a file but I would assume it would.</p>  <p>This is very annoying and If there is an option somewhere I do not know why Apple would not make it the default action.&nbsp;</p>
