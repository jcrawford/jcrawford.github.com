title: iPhone Price Dropping Before Release?
---
I was just reading a post over at [TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com/) and heard that the price of the Apple iPhone might actually be $200 cheaper than they announced.  With a contract you could be looking at paying $300 - $400 for the iPhone depending on whether you get the 4GB or 8GB model.  I really hope this is true and as the TUAW author says you should take this with a grain of salt.If you head over to the TUAW [post](http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/16/iphone-to-cost-only-300-400-with-contract/) you can actually see an image that states these prices, however we all know how easily an image can be manipulated.
