title: Looking into TomTom led to a detour
---
While I was looking into the TomTom POI's I started to wonder about incorporating Google Maps into a Cocoa Application that could handle creating custom POI sets for my device.  Well it led me on a small detour but I figured out how to incorporate Google Maps into a Cocoa Application and explain how in my article titled [Google Maps in a Cocoa Application](http://josephcrawford.com/macdev-articles/google-maps-in-a-cocoa-application/).  While I cannot say that I am an expert on Cocoa Development I have been learning a lot.  With that said you may find issues with my code, I don't doubt that.  I just figured since I figured out how to do it I would share with everyone.
