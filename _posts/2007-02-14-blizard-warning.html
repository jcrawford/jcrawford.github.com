We were supposed to get between 12-24" of snow by 7am today.  It is still snowing outside but we have nowhere near that much, we only have about 8" at the most.  I am glad we have not gotten that much snow yet and I hope we don't.  I have lived in VT all of my life and I am used to snow like this, but that does not mean I like it.  One day I will get away from VT and all of the snow, maybe live in one of the southern stated where it is almost always warm.

Over the last few years there are a few places that I have wanted to relocate to.  New York NY, Boston MA, Savannah GA.  I have come close to packing up and moving to Georgia.  We spend a lot of time in the Boston area and my favorite baseball team is there GO SOX!  If I lived in Boston I would definitely have season tickets or at-least attend the majority of home games.

Where will I end up?  When will I get there?  Who knows, but I know I will one day.
