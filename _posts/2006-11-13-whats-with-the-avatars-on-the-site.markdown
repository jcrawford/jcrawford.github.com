Some of you may have noticed that I integrated Gravatars however I had to quickly disable them because it was taking forever for a page to load that had a lot of comments.  I am going to look into the ability of making the comments have a paging mechanism (even write my own if I have to) and then i will turn them back on.  I would love to make use of the Gravatar system but it will also depend on the speed at which the service runs.
