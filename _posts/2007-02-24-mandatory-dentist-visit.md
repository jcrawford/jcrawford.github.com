title: Mandatory Dentist Visit
---
Over the past few days I have really been in agony with one of my teeth.Â  I went to the dentist today to get it extracted only to come home with pain pills, antibiotics and an appointment for Monday.Â  I have to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed Monday morning.Â  I am going to be out of work for a few days.Â  I am going to take this time to do A LOT of reading.Â  Mainly on my list is the new book I got that is all about using Google Maps and creating interactive maps for your visitors to use.I picked this book up tonight and it has been a very interesting read.Â  I am on page 87 already which seems rather fast but the content is direct and to the point with many code examples and screen shots of what the outcome is.Â  At this point I have to rate this book an 8 on a scale of 1-10.
