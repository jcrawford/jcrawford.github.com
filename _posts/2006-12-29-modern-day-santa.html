<p>I was watching a video posted on YouTube which was created by CBS.  It is a heart warming story of a family who was able to get away from an abusive man.  It also shows what can happen when you do everything you can to help others in a time of need.</p>
<p>Santa if you need a website contact me and I will get something together for you.  I really like the fact that you are doing this for people who would not be able to do it for themselves.  You are truly a hero.</p>
