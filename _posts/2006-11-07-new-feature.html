<p>I just wanted to take the time to point out a feature that you may not know about.&nbsp; Every author on this site has an archives page which you can easilly reach by clicking thier name which is in the header of every post.&nbsp; When you go to this page, there is information about that particular author that you would not get elsewhere on the site.&nbsp; I have made this page pretty much be the Author's page.</p><p>Give it a shot, just go up and click my name now.&nbsp;</p>
