<p>From the day I started this site I wondered if I would have to take any precautions for comment spam.&nbsp; I installed the Askimet plug-in for wordpress and made all comments have to be moderated.&nbsp; To this day I have received almost 10,000 spam comments which has led to a lot of work in reviewing the comments and making sure the ones marked spam really were spam.</p>  <p>I have decided to integrate a CAPTCHA program but not just any.&nbsp; I am using <a href="http://recaptcha.net/">reCAPTCHA</a> which is a free system for everyone to use.&nbsp; The difference between this system and others is that by using this you are actually helping digitize books that were written before they every thought of digitizing books.&nbsp; Why not help a good cause at the same time as protecting my blog from spam?</p>  <p>I am not sure if integrating this will make the site get even less comments or not.&nbsp; I know how people generally do not like these things but I am giving it a shot.&nbsp; If comments slow down or it does not deem itself useful then I will remove it.<br />  &nbsp;</p>
