title: A New way to make money

![](http://tinyurl.com/2x3f8m)I was browsing through PPP to see what new offers were out there and I ran into one from [The News Room](http://www.thenewsroom.com/landing/intro-getpaid01/?c_id=mb-ppp).  It seems really cool.  If you are looking for timely and relevant news for your site you should take a peek.  You can get paid for "mashing" news on your site.  If you put a video on your site you can get paid for every time it is viewed on your website.  I think YouTube needs something like this lol.I have only spent a few minutes going through the content on their website but it seems to be really good.  I have signed up for an account and will put things on here that peak my interest.Â  I have just tried to integrate this into my site.Â  I do wish they had smaller sized boxes with the video's or allow you to embed just 1 video.Â  It also seemed to play tricks with my layout so I might have to mess with the CSS for the elements to make it "look" good on my site.Â  I am not sure if that will violate the terms of service or not, but if it does I won't be using it on my site as it completely breaks the layout.Â  I will post more about how I get it to work once I figure things out.Â  It does look very promising and I hope to use this on the site.
