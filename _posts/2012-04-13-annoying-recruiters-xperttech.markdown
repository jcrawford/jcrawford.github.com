[![](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/xperttech1.jpg "xperttech")](http://www.experttech.com/)A while back I was conducting a job search and put myself out there on the job boards.  Since then I have found a position which I am happy with and have marked such on all job boards.  After closing down my job search I was contacted by XpertTech about a position which did not fit with my experience.  I informed the gentleman that it was not a match and went on with my day.  The very next day the EXACT SAME guy called me again about the EXACT SAME position.  I told him that I had already spoken with him about the position the day before and that I was not interested.  I requested to speak to a supervisor and the gentleman gave me the run around, was being very rude and then eventually hung up on me.[XpertTech](http://www.xperttech.com/) is headquartered in Waltham, MA and I tried my hardest to get a hold of a manager at that location and could not.  I went to their website and had to call the Chicago office in order to get a hold of anyone who would help.  I spoke to a person from the Chicago location and they had a manager call me back.  I told them about the gentleman who was rude to me on the phone and that they hung up on me.  They expressed they were deeply sorry and would handle the employee per company policies.  Over the last 2 weeks I have been getting HASSLED by the people from this company.  I am getting on average about 3 phone calls a day and 2 emails a day all from different people within the company.  I actually got an email yesterday from the same gentleman who was really rude to me and hung up on me.<!--more-->I have requested that they remove me from their database of candidates and when I request that I generally get some rude response about how I should remove my job board profiles.  Hello, if they even read anything on my profile it would show that I am no longer seeking a position.One email conversation I had yesterday is below:> Joseph,I believe I just spoke with your wife regarding a fantastic opportunity I have in Quincy, MA. This is T accessible and comes with free parking in their garage. I am looking for a Senior level developer to build interactive web-based applications on a LAMP platform. This company is growing at a 30% rate per year and offers 401k and profit sharing. Please let me know if you would like further details, thanks!Best,Albert AlphinResource Manager> Thank You but I am currently employed full-time and not looking for new opportunities at this time.Please forward this to a supervisor to make sure my request is followed through with.I have also requested that I be removed from your database as I was treated with a great deal of disrespect from a colleague of yours.  I requested to be removed when the manager called me back but it appears I am still in your database.If after this email I am not removed from your system and I receive even 1 more email from your company I will be contacting the attorney general and the better business bureau.Thank You,Joseph Crawford> Ok, sorry.Also,A good idea to stop receiving contacts from agencies is to remove your CV from the job boards, FYI.Best,Albert AlphinResource Manager> HelloIt's not that I don't want to hear about positions, I just don't want to hear about them from your company.  I have been called on numerous occasions about positions which do not meet my background and your employees who could not speak english very well.  I told the guy once that the position did not match my qualifications, he called me back the next day about the same position.  When I requested to speak to a supervisor the gentleman hung up on me.  I then had to email and call the Chicago Office before I got a manager from your office to call me.I requested removal from your system and if you do not remove my entry you are violating my rights.  I wish to be removed and NEVER contacted again by ANYONE from XpertTech.Thank You,Joseph Crawford> Sure thing, we do not have an office in Chicago. Best of luck though.Sent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerry> This is the exact reason I wish to have nothing more to do with your company.You DO have an office in Chicago and YOU didn't know it.  Apparently you guys don't know much, why would I ever want to work with you?Please verify with me that I have been removed from your system.This page shows your locations, maybe you should read it and get to know the company you work for.[http://www.xperttech.com/contact/](http://www.xperttech.com/contact/)Thanks,Joseph Crawford> Ok, I apologize for the inconveniences my company and I have caused you.Sent from my Verizon Wireless BlackBerryNow I know I might have been a little rude in the emails myself but I have been telling everyone in the company for the last 2 weeks (multiple times for some of these employees) that I do not wish to work with their company and wish to be left alone.  I have been told by supervisors that they will make sure I am not contacted again, but I keep getting contacted.How can I resolve this properly?  Is it the Attorney General I would write to and the BBB or another agency?  I know going there and kicking the door down is not going to be the right approach even though that's how I feel every-time one of these guys calls me.  I am beginning to think that they are all remote employees because they are all from India and never seem to be around a manager, I'm always told to email and someone will get back to me.Thoughts?
