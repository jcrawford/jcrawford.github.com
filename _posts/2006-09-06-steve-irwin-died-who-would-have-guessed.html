<p>I know this may seem morbid and cruel to some of you but i do not mean it to be that way.&nbsp; Everyone is talking and throwing a fuss about how the crocodile hunter has passed away due to a tragic accident with a stingray.&nbsp; I think everyone knew this day would come...&nbsp; You cannot just mess with the really dangerous wildlife and expect to not get bit or lose your life one day.&nbsp; Did he ever deal with Alligators or just Crocodiles?</p><p>Even FedEx predicted it would one day happen and i am sute that Steve had the notion that one day something could happen.&nbsp; Look at this video on <a target="_blank" title="YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>.</p><p>I do pass on respect to Steve's family and wish them the best while recovering from this loss.&nbsp;</p>
