title: Another Great Joke

Here is another great joke that was passed my way.>    Microsoft vs. GMAt a computer expo, Bill Gates reportedly compared the computer industrywith the auto industry and stated, "If GM had kept up with technologylike the computer industry has, we would all be driving twenty-fivedollar cars that got 1000 mi/gal."General Motors addressed this comment by releasing the statement, "Yes,but would you want your car to crash twice a day?"And...1. Every time they repainted the lines on the road you would have to buya new car.2. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for no reason, and youwould just accept this, restart and drive on.3. Occasionally, executing a maneuver would cause your car to stop andfail and you would have to re-install the engine. For some strangereason, you would accept this too.4. You could only have one person in the car at a time, unless youbought "Car95" or "CarNT". But, then you would have to buy more seats.5. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was reliable,five times as fast, twice as easy to drive, but would only run on fivepercent of the roads.6. The Macintosh car owners would get expensive Microsoft upgrades totheir cars, which would make their cars run much slower.7. The oil, gas and alternator warning lights would be replaced by asingle "general car default" warning light.8. New seats would force everyone to have the same size butt.9. The airbag system would say, "Are you sure?" before going off.
