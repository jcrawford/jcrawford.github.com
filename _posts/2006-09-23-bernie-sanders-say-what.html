<p>I am a supporter of Bernie Sanders over Rich Tarrant however something on the news tonight got to me.&nbsp; Bernie said he would set a law restricting US businesses from using people overseas as contractors.&nbsp; I totally agree that large corporations should not be able to run sweat shops.&nbsp; However I have a few people in other countries who do work for me, they do good work.&nbsp; I am not saying that US citizens do not do good work.&nbsp; Why should we be penalized for using people overseas who do GOOD work...&nbsp; Also Bernie needs to think if he disables us from employing any of them, how much work will we lose.&nbsp; I know i get work from Canada and the UK so if we cannot employ thier citizens why would they use US businesses for thier needs?&nbsp; In IT there is more to think about than what he is.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason i choose Bernie Sanders over Rich Tarrant is because Rich started with the negative ad's and thinks his money can get him whatever he wants.&nbsp; Also if you check Bernie's record for voting you will see that the reason he voted the way he did is because they bundle several things together.&nbsp; I am not a very political person nor do i really care about it, but when it effects my life i care.&nbsp; As for the Amber Alert Bernie does support it.&nbsp; But when they bundle several things like let's let more people live on welfare and also support the Amber Alert what do you do?&nbsp; Why bundle them together just vote on each item, that would take care of things.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
