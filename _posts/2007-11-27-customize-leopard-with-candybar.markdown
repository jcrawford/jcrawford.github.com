It was not that long ago that everyone was running around trying to figure out how to customize the Leopard dock.  Well the good guys over at Panic have released [Candybar 3](http://www.panic.com/candybar/) which is for Leopard only.  It will allow you to change your dock, along with a ton of other icons such as hard drives, trash, etc.
  
There are also many free Candybar iContainers over at [Icon Factory](http://iconfactory.com/freeware/icon).  Although I do personally think Candybar Wrappers would have been a better name for them ;)
