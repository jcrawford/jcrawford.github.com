title: Data Lost, Partially Recovered
---
If you have been following my blog the last few days you know that I lost almost a years worth of data.  I could have paid the web host $75 to recover the data but being that this is solely for my blog I opted not to do that.  Rather I have recovered most (if not all) of my missing posts by using Google Cache.  I did this by searching [Google for my site](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&q=site%3Ajosephcrawford.com+%2F2009%2F08%2F&aq=f&aqi=&oq=&fp=435311d5ec9ae78f) and then the /YYYY/MM/ string and clicking the cache link in the search results.  I do regret that all of my meta data such as comments/views etc for all of my posts have not been nor can they be recovered.  I apologize but at-least the content is there so that when people click web links they are not confronted with a 404.
