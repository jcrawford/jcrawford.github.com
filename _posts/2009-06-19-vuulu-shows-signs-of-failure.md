title: Vuulu shows signs of failure!
---
![Vuulu Homepage](http://josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/Picture-2.png "Vuulu Homepage")With any scam you are going to see failure however your job as a scammer is to at-least keep your website up and working.  If you click on the image to the left it should show a larger version.  This is a screen-shot of the Vuulu.com homepage at the time of this writing.  You can see that it is not showing any products listed.  Where did they all go?  Were they all won by the auto bidding bots?  Did the owner just forget to add more products and everything ran out of time?  The answer to this is REALLY simple..   WHO CARES?  They are on a venture to scam anyone and everyone they can, stay far far away from these guys.  Blog about this scam and get the word out.  Let everyone you know in on this little <del datetime="2009-06-19T11:10:20+00:00">secret</del> fact.<!--more-->I really do feel bad for the people who they are scamming because this is theft no matter how you look at it.  I just cannot believe that they can take a good business model like this and run it through the mud.  Now anyone who starts a site that even remotely resembles this model is faced with the task of proving they are not following the same business practices as these guys.
