If you run a blog you might have though about starting a [blog email](http://www.zookoda.com) mailing list.  Maybe you want to keep your visitors informed on a monthly basis what you have posted on your site.  Maybe you want to start up a list where you send out tutorials or how-to's.  There is a website I found today called [Zookoda.com](http://www.zookoda.com/) that will allow you to do just that.  You can start up mailing lists, where you can customize how the email looks 100%.  You can also set the confirm and thank you pages to be pages on your site.If all you would like to do is notify your readers about the new content on your site, you can setup broadcasts that will automatically go out at a set interval.  It will notify all of the users in the list about the content you have added since the last broadcast.  This is nice but I really do not see too many people taking advantage of that over RSS.  The one part I do love however is the ability to have a mailing list FREE of cost.  That's right Zookoda is a 100% free site to use.  I also love the ability to 100% customize how the email will look because I would want it to look similar to my site's theme rather than some canned look.Keep your eyes open on this site, I am going to start up a few mailing lists, one for Monthly PHP Tips and another for Monthly Mac Tips. If the response is good enough I will start up a more frequent mailing list that will offer much more than a tip ;)[
