Yesterday we found out that a friend of ours passed away.  We were unclear on what exactly took place yesterday but we have more of a picture now.  We have been told that he was out fishing at a lake in NY when he had a seizure and fell into the water.  He will be missed a lot by all of the kids he was around.  He loved playing with the kids when we would stay up in North Adams.  We are still unclear on all of the details of how it happened, information is still trickling in.

Our prayers go out to his family and friends that he has left behind.  Rest in Peace Elmer, you will be missed.
