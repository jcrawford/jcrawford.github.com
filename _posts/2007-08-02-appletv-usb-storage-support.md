title: "AppleTV: USB Storage Support"
---
If you have not yet heard there is now a hack for the AppleTV which will allow you to connect an external drive up to the USB port on the AppleTV.  This is a great achievement on the part of the developers.  It now means that you can have a 2TB drive sit next to your AppleTV and use that for storage of your movies.To read more and find out how to implement this, visit the [AwkwardTV blog post](http://www.awkwardtv.org/?p=52).
