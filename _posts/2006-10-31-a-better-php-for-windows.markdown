Today Andi Gutmans reported that Microsoft is teaming up with Zend to create a better PHP for windows.  Microsoft is actually creating a new FastCGI implementation that follows standards and will be integrating it into IIS 7.  I think it is great to see that Microsoft is actually getting involved with Zend to make a better PHP for Windows.  Many people use Windows for the development machine and this will make the process much better.  It makes me curious how many more people will start using windows for the web servers with this improvement.
