	for the Playstation 3 about a month ago and have actually had some time to play it.  It is a pretty good game.  I love the fact that when you go online and download updated rosters for off-line use.

	I have found that the on-line play for this game is not that great.  There are a lot of people with bad connections who drop out and then there are those who get mad when you score a few runs in the first inning and bail out of the game.  I have been playing a Franchise game using the <a href="http://www.redsox.com/">Boston Red Sox</a> as my team.  Franchise mode is really nice, you have to play each game as well as control ticket prices, vendor prices, and even parking prices.  When you are doing really good overall you can charge more for products and tickets.  If you are doing really bad then the customers will not pay a lot for products or tickets.  The AI in this game really surprised me though.  There has only been one instance where they called my guy out at 1st when he was never tagged.  The batter hit a line drive to 1st and they caught it without ever tagging the guy on 1st (I checked the replay several times) he was called out as well so they got a double play.

	<!--more-->I have however found several bugs in the game.  There are times when I will hit a ground ball that will roll out to center field and the announcer will say
	<blockquote>and that ball bounces off the wall, there should be extra bases here.</blockquote>
	When ever I hear that I just have to laugh.  Today however I found another bug.  I have not done much with trading players and decided to give it a shot.  I made an offer to the Yankees for Johnny Damon and they accepted.  While playing in game he wore the Red Sox uniform but when I was looking at any stats pages it would show him in the Yankees uniform.  At the end of the game when they showed the best player of the game he had the Yankees uniform on.  I am not sure if that was their intended result but I find it to be bad.  If you do a lot of trading you will see the players wearing different uniforms than they should be.

	There was also an instance where my opponent hit the ball to Alex Cora at 2nd Base and the announce said that the Short Stop Julio Lugo robbed them of the base hit.

	I love the game but I definitely think that they need to do more work on these games before they release them.  These are not huge issues but they are issues that I have found, why did the testers not find them?
