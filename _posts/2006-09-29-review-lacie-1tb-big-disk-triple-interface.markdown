When I bought my PowerMac Quad G5 Apple computer, I was pricing the hard drives, it was quite expensive for 2 x 500gb drives to be configured, plus I wanted to find something that would be hot swapable.  I took a look at the LaCie drives, I was really looking for a drive I could connect to my router and read from any computer on the network.  Initially I was looking at the [LaCie Ethernet Disk 1TB](http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10645 "LaCie Ethernet Disk 1TB") however this is pretty much a computer in it's own.  It has Windows XP embedded onto the drives and that is not something I wanted.  I wanted to have a drive on the network that did not have ANY OS installed.  LaCie did not offer a drive like that.

I ended up looking into the [1TB Big Disk](http://www.lacie.com/products/product.htm?pid=10128 "LaCie 1TB Big Disk") with a triple interface, it supported USB, FW400 and FW800.  I purchased the drive and installed it immediately.  I am happy with the drive for the most part, being that it is an external drive it does run a bit slow.  When you first access the drive it takes a few moments to show the directories and files.  I wish it was a bit faster however I have it connected via FW800 so there is no getting faster unless it was internal.  The disk has been good for backing my items up however is it setup in RAID 1 so if one drive fails I will lose all the data stored on the drive.  If you are looking for a good drive to use for backups and not just external storage I would not recommend this drive.  Instead I would look for something setup in RAID 3 or 5.
