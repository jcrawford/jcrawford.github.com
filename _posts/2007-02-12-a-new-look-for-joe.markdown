Last week I went to Lens Crafters and took an eye exam.  The exam confirmed my suspicion.  I needed glasses.  This is going to be a big change for me because I have never had to worry about the responsibility of glasses, nor did I have to worry about how I looked or felt with them on.![HAHA Too Funny](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/glasses1.jpg) These are the glasses HAHA I look awful in these.  These are not my real glasses but a pair that a friend of mine got for free and well with the cost of glasses today I guess you cannot get any better than free.  These are almost as bad as the classic BCG (Birth Control Glasses) glasses that you get in the military.  They are just not OK.  I remember when I went to basic training for the Marines and everyone who had to wear them dreaded them.  I am glad I did not have to wear those while in basic training.<!--more-->![Everyday Wear](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/glasses2.jpg)I found out that I needed to get 2 pair of glasses, one for everyday wear and one for wearing while I am working at the computer all day.  The one's you see to the right are the one's that I will be wearing everyday.  I do not think they look too bad on me although I tend to think I look better without them.  Wearing these will definitely take some getting used to.  I did choose the better looking name brand glasses for my everyday use, I ended up getting Brooks Brothers frame.![Computer Glasses](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/glasses3.jpg)The last pair I choose were not as nice as the everyday pair after-all I am only wearing them while looking at the computer, should I care what they look like?  They are not bad but they are not the brand name frames (insurance covered less on the 2nd pair).  However I did not realize that 2 pair of glasses would cost me $380 out of pocket.  I had no idea they were that expensive.  I guess the total for both pair was around $950.  Thank goodness for insurance they covered more than 1/2 of the cost.  I will have to learn how to take care of these because they are so expensive I could not afford to replace them that easily.  I am noticing that the computer glasses tend to make my eyes hurt after a bit of wearing them and things are more blurry than without them.  I just called Lens Crafters and inquired about that issue.  They told me that because I work on a 23" display and sit about 2-3 feet from the display these are not the best solution.  The computer glasses are made for 12-18" from the screen.  There is just no way possible I could sit that close to the screen.  I am going to try these for a few days but I might have to go in and have my prescription checked.So tell me what do you think of my new look?
