I was browsing YouTube tonight and I came accross a unique method for installing Windows Vista.  I had to laugh and I have to admit I feel the same way about Vista.  I have it installed with Boot Camp on my Mac Pro so that I can play games, but it seems to suck worse than XP.  You just have to see this video.  It's too much ;)  Let's hope most of the world uses this method when installing Windows Vista.<!--more-->[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxQm3IsSKAo]Now wasn't that just great ;)  This guy has a great sense of humor and I guess the ability to shred money :)
