We all know that Microsoft has had more than it's fair share of bugs in windows.  Earlier this year when Microsoft demonstrated Vista's Speech Recognition they were laughed at.  This morning I was browsing the web and came across an article on BBC News about another issue Vista's Speech Recognition.  This issue is MUCH worse however.  It seems there is a flaw that allows it to be hijacked and controlled remotely.Who hasn't wanted a computer that could tell itself what to do.  If you ask me this is a huge security risk because someone could hijack your machine and use the speech recognition to delete your files and folders and even empty your trash so that the files are not recoverable.  Now the way this is done is by having your speakers and microphone on.  You have to play an MP3 file which issues the commands and the microphone picks them up from the speakers.  Several people have already tried this and have successfully deleted files and emptied the trash.You can read more about [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6320865.stm) on the [BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/) website.
