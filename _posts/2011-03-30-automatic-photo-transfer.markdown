As many of you know I have recently gotten interested in photography.  Being the technophobe that I am I had to figure out a way to integrate technology with my digital photography hobby.  I was originally looking for a way to [preview my shots on the iPad](http://www.josephcrawford.com/2011/03/01/image-previews-on-ipad-in-the-field/) while in the field.  I figured out how to do that using the Eye-Fi SD memory card.  I have also found another way to use the Eye-Fi card and have all of my images automatically transfer to my home computer.  Yes this is something that Eye-Fi supports when you get close to your home network.  However how can you do this when you are in the field?<!--more-->The answer is very easily.  You just have to be able to have a wifi network in your pocket.  Most of you probably already carry a device capable of this every day.  Many smartphones can be turned into a wifi hotspot by installing an application on the device.  Other devices might require some hacking be done before you can enable this feature.  Personally I opted to get the 4G internet device offered by [Clearwire, Inc](http://www.clear.com).  This device is basically a small modem in my pocket which allows me to completely setup a network with security, etc.  It allows up to 8 devices to connect to it.  I have setup my Eye-Fi card with this network so that it can connect to the wireless network the device provides.  Every time I snap a shot it is uploaded through the wifi device to the Eye-Fi servers.  It is then distributed to my FTP server that I setup on my home machine and also to my Eye-Fi Application on my workstation computer.  Now you may be asking well why would I want to carry this device or my phone with me when taking pictures, can't I just have it upload when I run into an open wi-fi network?  The answer is yes, the Eye-Fi card can be setup to use any hotspot in the world provided you have an account for the paid services out there.  Any publicly available wifi connection can be used, with that said you could be in the heart of Boston snapping photos and when you go into a coffee shop for a break all of your photos will be uploaded.The end result is what?  Well any photo I take will always be pushed to my home computer so if the memory card fails while I am out shooting I do not lose all of the shots I have taken.  A good bonus is the fact that I am running around with a very expensive Digital SLR camera.  The odds of the camera getting stolen is quite high as they are a high value item but not overly large in size.  You might be wondering how that would help me..  Well armed with the Eye-Fi card remember all images shot are uploaded to my home computer, this is all hidden from the camera operator as they do not have access to my Eye-Fi account so they cannot change the settings or disable it.  When they start snapping pictures I am going to get them on my computer and hopefully they will be snapping shots of friends, family, etc.  I could then use those images as evidence and potentially find the camera before too long.  Now another good part.... I enabled GeoTagging so every photo that is put on my computer will be associated with a latitude/longitude combination, this is quite accurate from my tests.  I would know exactly where the photo was taken and can actually see it plotted on a map.  Further evidence if they should take a shot around their house just messing with the camera.The only way that they could bypass this is if they removed the Eye-Fi card.  Being that they probably won't have a clue what it is chances are they will not be removing it prior to snapping a few shots.  Besides lets face it, how many people know this Eye-Fi technology exists and who would think it could be used to track down any thieves?  What are your thoughts?
