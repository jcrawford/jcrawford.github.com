I am happy to hear that there is a php upload progress extension for PHP 5.2  You can read more about it [here](http://blog.bitflux.ch/archive/2006/09/28/upload-progress-meter-extension-for-php-5-2.html).  On the mailing list Rasmus Lerdorf brought up a good concern and that is about the storage mechanism. Will there be 1 extension that will deal with all methods of storagesuch as mysql, pgsql, oracle, files, etc. or will there be an extensionfor each method.  I think there should be 1extension, yes the code might get a tad messy but having an extensionfor each method would be very unorganized and messy.  I think the best way is to go with 1 extension.
