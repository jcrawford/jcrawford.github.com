title: WiFi Issues
---

Ever since I updated to Leopard I have been having issues with my WiFi network.  I seem to be the only system having the issues but then again I am the only one that has a mac.  For some reason OS X feels it needs to report to me that the wireless network has been compromised and will be disabled for about a minute.  I have never had this issue in the past and am not sure if the router is just not compatible with the mac.  It seems to happen every few days and when we looked in the router, there is no way anyone is accessing the network who is not supposed to be.  We have it secured with a WPA key.  If anyone here has any idea what could be causing this please leave me a comment.  I would love to never see this dialog again ;)
