I have to admit that when I started with PayPerPost I was a bit skeptical about whether or not they would pay out.  I have seen programs like this before that would pay you to surf or post things on your site and they did not survive or payout.  I received my first payout from PayPerPost the other day and I have been watching as each day I get more payouts in my Paypal account.

	What are your thoughts on the content I have been providing for PayPerPost?  I have been trying to keep to only relevant topics and certain topics that interest me but if it does not interest my readers it is pointless.  Please let me know your thoughts
