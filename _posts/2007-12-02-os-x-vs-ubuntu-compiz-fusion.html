<p>Before I bought my first mac through the years I have always jumped between windows and Linux distributions. Linux had not had the best user interface like OS X, it was just never a nice on the eyes.&nbsp; Last night my roommate was telling me about something he had seen a while ago called beryl.&nbsp; We found out that the beryl project had merged with the compiz project to create <a href="http://compiz-fusion.org/">compiz-fusion</a>.&nbsp; An excerpt from the compiz website tells you exactly what it is.</p>  <blockquote>  <p>Compiz Fusion is the result of a merge between the well-known Beryl composite window manager and Compiz Extras, a community set of improvements to the Compiz composite window manager. Compiz Fusion aims to provide an easy and fun-to-use windowed environment, allowing use of the graphics hardware to render each individual window and the entire screen, to provide some impressive effects, speed and usefulness.</p></blockquote>  <p>Although that tells you what it is in a nutshell there is nothing like seeing it in action to fully understand it so be sure to watch the YouTube video that I have embedded into this post.  It adds some pretty slick visual enhancements to the window manager and in my opinion it's pretty sexy.  From what I understand this runs below the window manager so I think you can use it with any window manager you so choose.  A lot of the effects that you will see are mostly just things you can do when you get bored but this is the future of operating systems.  I have seen some stuff like this in OS X but not anything nearly as cool.</p>  <p>  </p>  <!--more-->  <p>  <!-- more --></p>  <p>     <object width="425" height="355">  <param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZD7QraljRfM&amp;rel=1" />  <param name="wmode" value="transparent" />     <embed width="325" height="255" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZD7QraljRfM" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" class="floatleft"></embed></object>I just love how you can move the windows around really fast and make them jiggle like JELLO.&nbsp; As soon as I saw this I looked into the possibility of installing this side by side with OS X.&nbsp; I asked in a few IRC channels and people decided that they needed to be sarcastic and tell me sure you can, you just have to put the monitors next to each other. I finally figured out that it will install without any issues on a Mac, you just need to use a boot loader.&nbsp; My choice is rEFIt which I used in the past when I did a dual boot windows setup.&nbsp; I attempted to install Ubuntu using the CD ISO that I downloaded.&nbsp; It would not work for me.&nbsp; Not because I have a fancy Mac Pro but it is the fact that I decided to go all fancy with my mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; I have the Apple wireless keyboard and mouse which both run on blue tooth.&nbsp; This evening I will have to go pick up a cheap wired keyboard and mouse just to get through the installer.</p>  <p>The blue tooth stuff will work with Ubuntu once I get the OS installed, I guess the installer just will not detect them for me.&nbsp; I cannot wait to get this installed and see how fast it runs on my system.&nbsp; If I can get everything to work well with my work VPN connection etc (I'm sure there will be no problems) I might even decide to make Ubuntu my primary OS...&nbsp; Sorry Apple.&nbsp; If I do fall for Ubuntu I might just have to buy a cheap PC to install it on.&nbsp; I would sell my Mac Pro but with the way I can jump between OS's I would prefer to keep it for the future :)  </p>  <div>  <div>  <div>
