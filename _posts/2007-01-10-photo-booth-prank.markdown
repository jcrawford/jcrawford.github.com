It was a while ago but I do remember seeing this on TV, maybe it was on one of the daytime shows that my girlfriend watched.  If anything I would almost bet it was on the Ellen Show.  Check out the video below if you are up for a good laugh, it had me going for quite a while.  People should do more harmless pranks like this I cannot stop laughing.<object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" data="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-7492765266509368512&hl=en" width="425"> <param value="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=-7492765266509368512&hl=en" name="movie" /><param value="transparent" name="wmode" /></object>I particularly like the first one. Telling the kids they broke the photo booth is very clever.  But then to say the photo booth notified park security, too much.  My all time favorite is the very last one it is just too much.  I wonder if they held Universal Studios to that deal ;)I wish I could have been the voice behind the booth it would have been a lot of fun, although I am not sure how the woman was talking straight without laughing I wouldnâ€™t be able to.
