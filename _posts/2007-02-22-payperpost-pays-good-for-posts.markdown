I know most of you have noticed that I have removed the advertising on my site in exchange for writing (paid) reviews and posts which I find to be relevant topics.  I started with [PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g) [blog ad network](http://www.payperpost.com) almost a month ago and already I have racked up $135.00.  The one thing I have noticed are that there are quite a few opportunities on the [PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g) website that are offering a lot of money for a post.  I have seen one for $1000.00 for just 1 post.  Granted they are going to require that your site have a PR of 8 and a high Alexa rank but if you have the site why not take that opportunity?I am slowly working my way up the ranks at [PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g).  As you work your way up the ranks you qualify for higher paid opportunities.  I actually have gotten a few at $15 each and one at $35.  Now if you sign up for [PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g) you will have things happen to you like I did.  I took an opportunity for $35 and this week there is another from the same advertiser that is now $45 but they wont allow a blogger to take the second opportunity if they have previously made a post about them in the last 30 days.  I just lost $10 on that one.Not all advertisers say you cannot make another post about their service or product within 30 days however most of them do.  If you are up for making some cash and your blog is older than 90 days with at least 20 posts <strike>and with a PR of at least 3</strike> head on over to [PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g) and sign-up for a blogger account today.  If you have a product or service you just might want to think about advertising on [PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g).<http://www.payperpost.com/?utm_source=opportunity&utm_medium=disclosure%2Bbadge>
