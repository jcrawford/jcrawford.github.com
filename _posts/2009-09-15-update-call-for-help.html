<p>You might have seen my previous post titled <a href="http://http://josephcrawford.com/2009/09/05/call-for-help/">Call For Help</a> where I told you how I broke one of the retainer keys on my DiNovo Edge keyboard.  After days of searching for the retainer clip on-line I was about to give up as it seemed like no one had the darn piece.  I had sent out a lot of emails and questions via Ebay and got a quick response from <a href="http://myworld.ebay.com/oc_laptops/">oc_laptops</a>.  They asked me if I could send them some photos of what the clip looked like.  They stated that they had over 100 different types of these retainer clips.  It seemed hopeful that they would have the retainer clip as they carried so many of them.  About a day later they emailed me back with a photo of the exact retainer clip except it was white not black.  I quickly ordered one and they shipped it rather quick.</p>

	When I got the clip it was exactly the same other than the color so I was very excited.  My excitement went downhill the moment I tried to install it though.  The clip fit perfect however during the installation I broke this clip.  I learned my lesson the hard way and have ordered 3 more so that I have backups.  If you plan to buy replacement clips be sure to contact this seller and provide them with photos.  This specific retainer clip was the one for the right shift key.  If you need a shift key retainer clip you can buy <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;item=370168363672&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT">one of these</a> and it will work perfectly.</p>
	<p>I usually do not review my eBay purchases on my site as I use the eBay feedback system for that, however this one item is so hard to find I felt I had to post it for all of the DiNovo owners who might have a key broken.</p>
