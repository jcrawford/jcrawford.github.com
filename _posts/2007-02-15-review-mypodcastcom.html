Just about everyone should know what a podcast is but if you do not know they are radio style talk shows that you can listen to.  They are not streamed however, they are recorded and then you can download them and listen to them whenever you wish.  You can listen on your computer or portable MP3 player like the iPod or Zune.  If you are currently spending a lot of money on bandwidth for your podcast you may want to take a look at <a href="http://www.mypodcast.com">MyPodcast.com</a> which offers a <a href="http://www.mypodcast.com">Free Podcast</a> with unlimited storage,unlimited bandwidth and free templates for your podcast.

If you do not currently have a podcast but have been thinking about starting one, this is where I suggest you start.  After-All there is no better price than FREE.  MyPodcast.com also has a method setup for you to make money through every download of your podcast.  This program is still in the infant stages however they are displaying advertisements with every download and are going to share the pie with the podcast owner.  Not many companies are willing to do this, they feel that if you are getting a free service all advertising revenue should go to them.  This company is giving you a way to at least make a little bit of money from your hard work.

If you are looking for a central place to find podcasts to listen to, maybe you should head on over to MyPodcast.com.  They have a way to search through all of the hosted podcasts to find just what you are looking for.<img src="http://www.counttrackula.com/tracker/images/3267/3108.gif" />
