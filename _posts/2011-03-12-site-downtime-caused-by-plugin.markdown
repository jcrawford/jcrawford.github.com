To all of my readers who noticed my site was showing the 404 page for every page on the site I apologize.  The issue is now fixed.  I noticed the issue this morning and started to diagnose the issue.  It appears that a plugin I recently installed caused the issues.I had recently installed the [Broken Link Checker](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/broken-link-checker/) plugin which appearedto corrupt some of my database tables.  If this has happened to you there is however some good news to accompany the bad news.  If you repair all of your tables either using direct database commands or phpMyAdmin this should solve your issues.  If it does not I am afraid you will probably have to restore your database from a backup.
