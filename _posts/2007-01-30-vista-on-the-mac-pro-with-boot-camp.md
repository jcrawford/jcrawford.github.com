title: Vista on the Mac Pro with Boot Camp
---
Today I installed the final release of Vista on my Mac Pro with Boot Camp. I must say it is working rather well. The blue-tooth keyboard and mouse seem to be working better than in XP. Microsoft must have bumped up the bluetooth support in Vista.There are a few issues though (and I have yet to dig for a solution) When you installed XP you had to create a drivers disk with the Boot Camp Assistant. With Vista it detects the video card and supports that however there are still several devices that are not recognized. I tried to install the Windows XP drivers but a fatal error occurred during the install (I figured it would fail). However now I need to find the Apple Vista drivers and I am not sure they even released any.I am going to do some digging but I do think Vista runs better than XP on the Mac Pro.Â  The one thing in particular that I noticed and do not like is the fact that both XP and Vista only see one of the 2 processors in the machine and only 2 of the 4 GB of ram that the machine has.
