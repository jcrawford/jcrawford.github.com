As some of you may know I recently made the switch from PC to Mac.  I am loving the Mac, the only drawback is that I need a laptop as well.  The prices on the laptops are out of my reach at the current time.  I have 2 fully loaded PC's here that I would be willing to sell/trade someone for an Apple laptop.  The specs are below.<!--more-->The First System:- AMD 64 3500+
- 2GB RAM
- 2 x 200 Western Digital SATA Hard Drives
- 256MB Nvidia Video Card
- Thermaltake Xaser III Super Tower
- 16x DVD +/- RW
The Second System:- AMD 64 4400+ Dual Core
- 2GB RAM
- 2 x 250 Western Digital SATA Hard Drives
- 256MB Nvidia Video Card
- 16x DVD +/- RW
- Creative Labs Sound Blaster X-FI Platinum 7.1 sound card with remote and front panel inputs
These systems have been sitting here collecting dust.  I no longer run windows nor do I wish to.  I guess I could throw linux on one but... Why?  OS X is built on BSD ;)If anyone is interested I can provide more detailed specifications on ANY of the internal parts, I can even provide high quality pictures.  I built these machines myself I just do not remember all of the model numbers off the top of my head.I would be willing to trade one or both of these for an Apple laptop (depending on condition and specs).  I am also a professional PHP Developer and could also work for the laptop if you run a website.I have tried many things such as SwapThing and have had no luck finding anyone who has Apple laptops for trade.
