I finally have upgraded to WordPress 2.1.  However it did take some work to get my theme to work properly because the developers did not take backwards compatability into consideration.  I had to write some custom functions to get my sidebar to work the way it does.  It seems they altered the database to combine the links categories and the blog categories so that led to some trouble.

I have everything (I believe) working properly again.  If you see any issues please leave a comment letting me know about them.
