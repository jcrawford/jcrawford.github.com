title: iTunes Cover Art
---

I have recently noticed that iTunes does not store the cover art in the ID3 tag like most other applications.  They actually store them in ~/Music/iTunes/Cover Art/, it makes sense to do this since they can query one directory rather than every song's ID3 tag.  I am sure performance is a big thing here.  However i have opted not to use the iTunes Cover Art.  I have been going to amazon and applying the cover art to the ID3 tag, if i move the file i want the art to go with it.  Also i have had some issues of iTunes not being able to provide the cover art for certain albums.

I have also heard reports of people using the cover art and getting the incorrect covers from iTunes.  They still need to put a bit more work into the cover art before i will use it...
