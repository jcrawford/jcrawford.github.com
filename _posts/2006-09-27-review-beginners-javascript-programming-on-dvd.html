<p>So a few months back I wanted to learn more about web development.&nbsp; Currently I am focused on PHP however i would like to be more well rounded and know more than just PHP.&nbsp; I bought a few books about JavaScript and also a book on DVD.&nbsp; I have been able to preview some of the Total Training videos for Photoshop, and they were very informative and they get the instructions through to the end user.&nbsp; They were also very fun to watch, you could tell they were not low budget videos.&nbsp; The book on DVD that i bought is called Beginners Javascript Programming on DVD by DV Press, Inc.&nbsp; although I bought the item from Amazon.</p><p>I would never recommend this book on DVD to anyone.&nbsp; The content (from what i was able to watch) seemed to be decent however i could not sit through the instructor.&nbsp; He is so boring and bland and blah.&nbsp; I am not quite sure how to explain it.&nbsp; You would have to see it to understand, and I am sure that posting a bit of the course on here would violate copyright laws so I cannot do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; You would think that if a company was going to record something it would not be so bland.&nbsp; It's so bad that i could not get passed chapter 3.&nbsp; The guy talks in the same tone constantly, it will just about put you to sleep.&nbsp; I have this DVD sitting on my desk and i think i will throw it away.&nbsp; I would put it on ebay but i would feel bad actually selling this to someone whether i know them or not.</p><p>I cannot speak about other DV Press, Inc books on DVD however if they have the instructor Harold Davis i would stay away from them.&nbsp; DV Press, Inc. really needs to get some people who are not only good programmers but whom are good on camera as well.&nbsp; In the future i may try another DV Press, Inc. book on DVD but it wont be with this instructore, and if the next is just as bad I won't purchase another DV Press, Inc. product</p>
