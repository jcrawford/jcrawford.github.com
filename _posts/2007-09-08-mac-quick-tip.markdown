Tonight while I was in #MacOSX on Freenode something was brought to my attention.  Agatha said that if you drag a whole heap of images and drop them on the Preview.app icon they will all open up in the same preview window.  You can use this to preview each picture and if you want to delete them from your disk you just hit command-delete.  This is a great tip and it will be very useful for me.  Thanks for passing this along Agatha ;)
