A while back I mentioned that I got the new Mac Pro and that I would be showing some benchmarking between the Quad G5 and Mac Pro.  I have completed the benchmarking and testing of the Mac Pro and I really do have to say that I think it is close to being twice as fast as the Quad G5.  I have been ripping my DVD library to my computer getting prepared for Apple TV.  On the G5 it would take an hour and twenty minutes to rip and encode the movie in H.264 quality.  On the new Mac Pro it takes only 45 minutes per movie.   While I do not run Photoshop on a daily basis I borrowed a friends copy of CS2 so that I could compare the performance.  Photoshop CS2 definitely runs faster on the PowerPC processor, however I did not find that it was too slow to work with.

I really love the new Mac Pro and look forward to utilizing it for the years to come.
