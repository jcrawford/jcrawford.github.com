Hey everyone, I am sorry it has been a while since my last post before today.Â  I have been going through a lot of stuff in life that I have needed to make a priority.Â  I am recently separated and have my own apartment.Â  On top of trying to get things squared away there I have also been trying to work with the Attorney and the Office of Child Support to nail down what my monthly support will be.Â  I am also working on getting a visitation schedule down on paper so that I can see the kids on a regular basis.Things are slowly getting back on track and I will be posting on here more frequently than I have been.
