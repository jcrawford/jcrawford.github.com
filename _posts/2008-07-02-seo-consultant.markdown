In the past I have always done my own SEO stuff for my site.  It has always been a pain in the rear and takes quite a bit of time submitting to directories and search engines.  The other day I found [SEO Consultant](http://www.shimonsandler.com/?p=200) which seems to offer quite a balance of services that you would require for SEO optimization.

I would never use a service like this for my own blog however I do have a project planned for the future that I would use their services for.  They are not the cheapest guys I have seen around but witht he services they include you are getting a lot for your money.  They charge a retainer of $2000 for 10 hours per month of services.  This equates to $200 per hour.  Boy am I in the wrong business.

If you want your site to rank in the top of the search engines or to improve your page rank [SEO Consultant](http://www.shimonsandler.com/?p=200) is the way to go.  Once I get my project off the ground or funding for it I plan to contract a company like this.  You cannot just expect to start a site and have everyone just know about it without any marketing or search engine optimization.
