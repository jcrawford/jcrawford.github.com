title: Leopard Quick Look Plug-ins
---

In Leopard we all know that you can open a finder window, select a file or folder and hit the space bar to enable Quick Look to get a preview of the file.  However by default if you have a folder selected it will show you an image of a folder.  This is not very useful.  I would like to see the contents of the folder when i enter Quick Look.  This is where Quick Look plug-ins come into play.  The developers over at Apple made Quick Look support an open architechture so that developers could create their own plug-ins to support more file types.
  
Taiyo (a Japanese developer) has written 2 such plug-ins.  They are both really useful.  The [Folder Quick Look Plug-in](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t_trace/20071124/p3) will allow you to view the contents of a folder, I think Apple should have had this as the default behavior.  The [Zip Quick Look Plug-in](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/t_trace/20071125/p2) will allow you to see what files are contained in the zip file that you selected.  Very handy if you do not want to extract something when you are not sure if it is the correct archive.  All you have to do is download the zip files and place the *.qlgenerator files in the /Library/QuickLook/ folder and they should work automatically.
