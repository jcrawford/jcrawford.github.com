This week I finally decided that I am going to upgrade to the Mac Pro.  Currently I have the Quad-Core Power Mac G5 with the following specs:
<ul>
	<li>4 x 1GB Sticks of Ram</li>
	<li>2 x 250 GB Hard Drives</li>
	<li>Upgraded Video Card</li>
	<li>Airport</li>
	<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>
I am trading it in for the Mac Pro with the follwing specs:
<ul>
	<li>2 x 2GB Sticks of Ram</li>
	<li>250 GB Hard Drive</li>
	<li>Airport</li>
	<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>
From what i am told this is a minor down-grade because I will be losing a hard drive, however I believe the video cards are equivelent at least for what I will be using it for.Â  I am going to run some benchmarks on this machine and then will run the same tests on the Mac Pro and will post the differences here.

Several people are wondering why I would be trading this machine in so soon, afterall I have only had it for 6 months.  The big decision maker for me was the Intel Xeon processors and the fact that the Mac Pro has more parts that are upgradable.  I love the fact that there are several video cards that you can get for the machine and that it supports 2 optical drives and up to 4 hard drives.  I will also like the ability to run Windows natively on the machine using Parallels or the like.  There are only a few reasons to use windows and one is to play games.Â  I look forward to receiving this new machine on Wednsday.

I will keep everyone posted on whether or not I actually think it is 2x faster than this G5 as I am told by so many people.
