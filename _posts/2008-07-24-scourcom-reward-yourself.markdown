Many of us spend quite a bit of our days searching the web either using Google, Yahoo or some other search engine.  These search engines make billions of dollars every year through advertising in your search results.  Why not do something so that you can benefit too?  [Scour.com]( http://scour.com/invite/jcrawford "Scour.com: Reward Yourself") is a search engine that will return results from Google, Yahoo and MSN.  I am sure that in the future they will expand what engines they include in the results.  The best part is there is a points reward system for your searching.  The more points you earn the more money you can make.  While it takes a while to build up the points to get a reward why not take the time since you do searching anyway?So how do you earn points and just how many points does it take to get a reward?  Well everytime you run a search you will earn 1 point.  If you rate a search result positive or negative you will earn 2 points.  You can earn 3 points by leaving a comment about a particular result that you found to be good or bad.  The more points you rack up the better so the more active you are on [Scour.com]( http://scour.com/invite/jcrawford   "Scour.com: Reward Yourself") the better.  Now it does take 6,500 points just to get a $25 gift card but what other search engine would give you this?Another good thing is that for every person you invite you earn 25% of the points they earn as well.  You will both collect points.  The more people you invite the faster your points will build up.  Be sure to go over to Scour.com and check out what they have to offer.  They have a nice UI which shows the rankings of the results on Google, Yahoo and MSN so you can always see where the results rank with the engines.  Since I always use Google I think I will be using [Scour.com]( http://scour.com/invite/jcrawford   "Scour.com: Reward Yourself") from now on.  I get the same results and can even be rewarded for doing my searches.  Why didn't Google start this themselves?
