title: Best Batteries for the Wireless Mighty Mouse
---

When I purchased the Wireless Mighty Mouse I was amazed at how long the batteries lasted.  They finally died after about 2 months of everyday use.  When I say everyday use I mean M-Sat. 8AM â€“ 6PM I am constantly using the mouse.

When the batteries finally died I ran out to Radio Shack and bought the best rechargeable batteries they had, however I am not sure they are the best.  In fact I think they are horrible at least when used with the Mighty Mouse.  The batteries I bought are the Radio Shack brand.  They are green 1.2v 2100-mAh Nickel-Metal Hydride rechargeable batteries.  They were like $20 for 4 of them. This price also included the charger.  I will fully charge them for a day until the light on the charger is green.  When I first insert them into the Mighty Mouse and check the power in system preferences it only has 3 out of the 5 bars lit up green.  At first I thought there was something wrong with system preferences however when the batteries were dead after 3 days I knew it was the batteries.

The question is: What are the best batteries you have found to use with your Wireless Mighty Mouse?  Please leave a comment and let me know I am willing to try anything.  I would prefer rechargeable batteries but would be open to suggestion.

If you are out looking for a decent battery for your Wireless Mighty Mouse I highly suggest you stay away from these batteries.  I am not quite sure what to suggest you use however i will keep you updated as I try different brands.
