title: "Epic Failure: Product Design"
---
I have been meaning to write about this since last Easter but the product was kicking around my house and forgotten about for a while.  The other day I stumbled upon it and thought I would bring it into work and share it with my co-workers.  Everyone thought it was funny and an epic failure.Anyhow during the time before Easter when every parent does their duties I was walking through Walt-Mart's Easter isle and noticed a lollipop.I brought the product up to the customer service desk and asked if they knew it was in the candy isle.  The girl just looked at me like I was stupid and said yes.  I then asked if she realized it was SOAP, when she heard that she reached out for the product and inspected it closer.  When she noticed it was in-fact soap she immediately had the product pulled from the shelves.  The issue though is that the box that was holding a lot of these items was nearly empty which means many people did purchase them.Now this product was manufactured by [Townley Girl](http://www.townleygirl.com) and I find even more humor in the fact that when you visit the site you don't see anything related to this product or any product like it.If you find it hard to read please click the image to see a larger version.  I just could not believe that this product made it through the initial brainstorming phase never-mind actually shipping it out the door to retailers.  I also have to state that this product was sold with a cardboard backing and plastic covering the front, however it did not state it was soap except for very small print.  I also wonder just how many kids popped one of these in their mouth Easter morning.  Did they say hey mommy/daddy this tastes funny or did they just go on with eating it because they knew no better.  Now I have not actually tasted this soap lollipop but I can imagine it tastes bad.  That is unless the manufacturer made it taste good too!Did you find yourself looking at this product too?  Did your kid actually get to the point of putting it in their mouth?  Don't worry I wouldn't consider that bad parenting so you can be honest :)
