<p>I am happy to announce that I have hit the first milestone for this site, i never thought it would be after the second month of being live.&nbsp; My goal withing the first 4 months was to get 1000 visitors here in a month.&nbsp; In August we had about 500 readers, and in September we jumped to just over 1000.&nbsp; I want to thank all of you who read this site and look forward to making this site even better over time.&nbsp; I hope that the content i provide will be enough to occupy your free time ;)&nbsp;</p>
