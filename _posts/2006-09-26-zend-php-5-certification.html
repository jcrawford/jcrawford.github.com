<p>So are you getting prepared to take the new PHP 5 Certification Exam offered by Zend?&nbsp; I have yet to see any books released for the preparation like i did with the PHP 4 exam, however there is something new and very cool.&nbsp; php|architect offers a Mock Tesing Environment which is powered by Vulcan Web Testing System.&nbsp; It is a Java based system that is very nice and easy to use.&nbsp; The mock exam is comparable to the Zend Exam because it will give you a 90 minute window to complete the exam, the same as Zend.&nbsp; The questions are not the same as the one's on the Zend exam however they have made the Mock Exam a bit more difficult than the Zend Exam.&nbsp; If you score well on the Mock Exam you are ready to take the Zend Exam.&nbsp; I have purchased a 5 slot exam so that i could write this review.&nbsp; I must say that the questions on the Mock Exam are directly related to PHP 5 and the new features such as PDO and SimpleXML.&nbsp; If you plan to cram for the exam do not just focus on the internals of PHP but also study the most popular extensions as well.&nbsp; PDO, SimpleXML, MySQLi, SPL, etc.</p><p>I would highly suggest that you take the Mock Exam before you go to take the real one ;)&nbsp; You can purchase the exam from php|architect in a single exam, 5-slot or 10-slot exams.&nbsp; If you have taken the Mock Exam let me know what your thoughts are.&nbsp; I firmly believe that it is well put together and will be a successful for helping people prepare for the new exam offered by Zend.</p>
