title: PHP Throwdown! You Got What It Takes?
---

So there is a new contest that is in the planning and development stages.  It’s called [PHP Throwdown](http://www.phpthrowdown.com "PHP Throwdown"), it is a 24 hour coding contest.  You can compete either as an individual or a team.  The goal is to complete the best application within the 24 hour time period.

Do you think you have what it takes?  I can almost guarantee that the competitors in this contest will only get a few hours sleep (if any) so it will take quite a bit if you plan to take part.

There will be 4 categories for applications which you can compete in, however they are still to be determined.  They also have not disclosed any of the prizes which you will be competing for.  I am sure that will come soon.

I have yet to determine if I will take part in this contenst, I will need to wait and see what the categories are and if I can come up with ideas of what to do.  However if I do take part i would want a designer to work with me to make it look good so drop me a line if you would be interested.  I would also have to see what the prizes are.

So when will this contest take place?  January 27th 2007 so mark your calendars!

If you have any ideas on what the categories should be, feel free to drop by [the site](http://www.phpthrowdown.com/ "PHP Throwdown") and contact contest admin.
