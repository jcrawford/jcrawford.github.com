title: Favorite ways to save money online

With Valentines day coming up there will be a lot of people completing transactions at on-line retailers, here are a few tips that could save you some money.  When you are doing on-line shopping you should take some time and research the product at many different vendors.  Everyone sells the same products but there could be 30 different stores that will have the same product at different prices.This is what I do when I am shopping on-line.  First I go to Price Watch and find the vendor with the lowest price, sometimes this turns out to be vendors like Amazon or Newegg.  When it does I make sure to go over to FatWallet to see if they are taking part in any cash back programs, if they are I will generally use that because who does not like to get cash back.If the vendor is not taking part in any cash back programs I will search sites like [Coupon Chief](http://www.couponchief.com/ "Coupon Chief") and see if there are any coupons for the product I am purchasing. I mean just take a look at how many [BestBuy coupons](http://www.couponchief.com/bestbuy_coupons/bestbuy.html "[BestBuy][Coupons]") are on this site.  Many times I will find a coupon or a cash back program that will allow me to save even more money on the product.  [Coupon Chief](http://www.couponchief.com/ "Coupon Chief") is not your everyday coupon site, all of the coupons on the site are for on-line retailers.Many people who do shopping on-line just go to their favorite retailer and buy the product at face value, I feel this is just wasting money.  If you can find a coupon or get cash back DO IT.  Even if you only save $2 it's worth the trouble because it's money back in YOUR pocket.
