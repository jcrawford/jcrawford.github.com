excerpt: I am sure I am not the only guy who is blasted via email and websites such as LinkedIn by recruiters who have not even taken a second to look at your resume.  Today I was blasted about a C# .NET position which is NOT on my resume at all.

I am sure I am not the only guy who is blasted via email and websites such as LinkedIn by recruiters who have not even taken a second to look at your resume.  Today I was blasted about a C# .NET position which is NOT on my resume at all.<pre>Joseph,Hello! How are you? I wanted to reach out - we are currently working on numerous C#.NET opportunities in the Greater Boston Area.  If you have any referrals or know anyone that is a great developer that I could start a referral chain with, I would greatly appreciate it!! If you are interested yourself, even better -- please let me know when I can get in touch with you!--Debdcoleman@rezulttechnology.com*Contract - Lexington, MA*Permanent - Lexington, MA*Contract - Woburn, MA*Contract - North Andover, MA*Permanent - North Andover, MA</pre>I in-turn replied with my response:<pre>Hello Debbie,Please do not just blast me with these spam messages. Nowhere on my resume does it state that I have ever done .NETYou are not doing your job as a recruiter if you are just blasting people *hoping* that someone will pass you a referral so you can fill your position with the least effort on your part.While you don't have any initial connections that does not stop you from contacting user groups, job boards, etc. Hey it looks like you've figured out how to use LinkedIn, now all you have to figure out how to do is YOUR JOB!Please remove me from your mailing list and ALL [Rezult Technology](http://rezulttechnology.com/ "Rezult Technology") lists.Thanks,Joseph Crawford</pre>I am not sure if I was a bit too harsh but the fact is I am sick of deleting useless emails from recruiters who are hoping to catch that next big fish.  It kinda goes in-line with an article a friend of mine wrote: [How not to get a potential clientâ€™s attention with email](http://www.jvmediadesign.com/blog/business/how-not-to-get-a-clients-attention-with-email/)
