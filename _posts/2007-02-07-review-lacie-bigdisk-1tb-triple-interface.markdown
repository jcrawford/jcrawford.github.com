A while back I bought the LaCie 1TB BigDisk Triple Interface drive.Â  It supports FireWire 800, 400 and USB 2.0.Â  I have been using this drive for a while now as an external backup and it has been great.Â  However it has a few flaws that they pushed in as features which I hate.If the drive is running for a while and is not accessed it will go into a suspended state to save on power.Â  This is nice but when you want to access something on it, you have to wait literally 5 - 6 seconds before the drive is again active.Â  Since I bought the new Mac Pro I was thinking about taking the 2 500 GB drives and throw them internal into the machine.Â  After a bit of research I found out that the 2 drives are IDE.Â  Who the hell uses IDE anymore?I am going to try to sell this LaCie drive and buy some SATA 500GB drives to throw internally into this system.Â  I am not sure why they would give it FireWire 800 connections and then throw IDE drives into the unit.Â  I might be wrong but I thought IDE was slower than FireWire.
