A long time ago I was searching for a site that had a lot of wallpapers to offer for my computer desktop.  I ran into [DigitalBlasphemy.Com](http://www.digitalblasphemy.com/) which literally has more wallpapers that even I know what to do with.  Back then they only had wallpapers for a single display setup.  Today they have wallpapers ranging from single display to tripple display setups.  The quality of the wallpapers are amazing, they put a lot of precision into the designs.A few months back I decided that I wanted to buy a membership, the only decision I was facing was to buy a 1 year membership or a lifetime membership.  The prices for the memberships are really affordable for everyone.  At the time of writing this the memberships prices are as follows:<!--more-->- 1 Year / $25
- Lifetime / $99
As you can see they are really affordable.  If you are going to use the site for 4+ years you might as well buy the lifetime membership.  My account expires in the year 2107 so it is the lifetime of the person buying the account (well 100 years anyway).They are always adding new designs to the collection and you can even download all of the designs in a zip file.  If you feel the need (if you are on dialup) you can order all of the designs on CD-Rom. (i bet it would take a DVD though).  I have downloaded all of the single display wallpapers to my computer and so far they are a whopping 336 MB.  As you can see they will take up some space on your disk.  I have downloaded a total of 876.1 MB for the single / dual / tripple display setups.  I am not sure if I have all of them yet or not and I will probably never know.If you have never seen the works posted on DigitalBlasphemy.Com you should do yourself a favor and go take a look at what they have to offer.  You cannot beat the prices for the quality of the images.
