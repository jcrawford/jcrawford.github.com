Early this morning at 1am OUYA kicked off the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console" title="OUYA on Kickstarter">Kickstarter project</a> to get funding for a new Android 4 based gaming console that would be an open system.  I was unable to support the project on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> but I will buy one if they become a reality.  A $99 gaming console will break into the market, I'm sure it's graphics will not be as great as the new consoles which are on the horizon but this will change how consoles are seen.  It will be an open system and ANYONE can develop games for it without having to buy into some heavy priced SDK.

	In 16 hours the project was funded on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/" title="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> raising an impressive $950,000.  The best part is we anticipated it would be funded by 5pm today and it was in-fact.  But the best part is that it went from $925,000 to around $950,353 in just 10 minutes.  I cannot believe that in 10 minutes they raised $25,353, I mean that's $2112.75 every minute.  I really hope to see this become a reality!!!
