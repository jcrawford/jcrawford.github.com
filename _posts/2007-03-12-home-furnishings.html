Over the last few weeks I have been looking at home furnishings for the apartment that I will be moving into.  I am not looking forward to buying everything again.  The first thing I had to look at was <a href="http://www.greatpricedfurniture.com/bedroom-furniture.html">bedroom furniture</a> and I think I have finally found the set that I like.  It is a bit expensive for my taste but it seems like all of the companies are comparable.

	Once I get moved in I am going to have to buy 2 more beds for the kids and a crib for the baby.  I wish I could just buy all of the furniture that I would need for the place in one shot but that would lead to tens of thousands of dollars.  Hopefully the furniture that I purchase will last me several years.  I bought a bed, dresser with mirror, armior and 2 night stands.  I also got the pillow top mattress so that I could sleep easier at night.  On the list of things to buy are beds, dressers, toyboxes and the such for the kids, but I will also need to buy a fouton or couch for the livingroom and a small dining room table.

	That is just the beginning.  Oy why do things have to be so expensive?
