I apologize to all those who downloaded iPHP v1.0 beta, there were a few issues keeping users from easilly installing the module.Â  These issues have been fixed.I have also made it so that the url's used in iPHP now use www.php.net so that the appropriate mirror is choosen for the user.

You can download iPHP on my [iPHP module page](http://www.josephcrawford.com/php-irc-modules/iphp/ "iPHP v1.1 beta").
