I am not going to outline all of the details of what took place in this post.  Rather I am going to be posting the entire letter that I am sending to the Board of Trustees or CEO of Sovereign Bank.  The activity outlined in the document that is being sent unprofessional to the point that I never want to even hear the name Sovereign again.  Please read the letter to read about a very detailed incident that took place this morning at one of my local branches.

	<strong>** UPDATE **</strong><br />
	About an hour after I sent that letter to corporate I was again called back by the gentleman named Craig.  When asked he informed me that Jonathan is *not* a member of the management team and that he was going to take care of this issue to his fullest extent.  He told me that he could not tell me what actions would be taken due to corporate policies.  I explained that I was not trying to tell him how to do his job and was not saying fire the guy.  All I want done is whatever your corporate guidelines mandate.  If that means he will get written up then that&#8217;s what it means.  If it means he gets fired then so be it.  However I wanted something done.  He apologized deeply and stated that he knows I am not a customer of the bank but if I go into that branch (or any other) and do not receive amazing service he wants to hear about it.  I am going to let things be as they should after a situation like this but I can sleep now knowing that something will be done because at-least now Craig&#8217;s bosses know about this situation so he will have to do something.
