<p>Since late 2000 I have been thinking of building a CarPuter (as they are called) however the costs were expensive.  I needed to take the time to plan out how I would install the system, modify the vehicle as needed, etc.  It was just more than I wanted to take on financially and time wise.  Now however I am thinking about integrating one into a car I plan to buy within the next few months. </p>

<p>You might be wondering why in the world anyone would want to put a computer in their car..  There are many reasons, below are just a few.</p>

[styled_list style="arrow_list" variation="green"]
<ul>
	<li>Music
	<li>Movies
	<li>Gaming
	<li>GPS Integration
	<li>Satellite Radio Integration
</ul>
[/styled_list]


<p>Just so there is no confusion I am not the first person to do this.  Many people have done this so I am not engineering anything.  I am simply going to follow guides that I find online and seek any assistance I may need from the community at <a href="http://www.mp3car.com/">mp3car.com</a>, there is actually a nice post of someone installing a system into a <a href="http://www.fastmatt.com/carputer/">2005 Mazda3</a> which is worth taking a look at.</p>

<p>The ideas of what could be done are almost endless, the guys over at mp3car.com have really done a good job of outlining what could be done in their <a href="http://www.mp3car.com/index.php/Getting-Started/Car-Computing-101.html">Car Computing 101</a> article.  There are even relay switches that you can install in your car that can interface with a light meter and have your headlights switch from hi/low beams automatically as necessary.  This is one thing that I am going to look at integrating.</p>

<p>The main interests for me to integrate this would be so that I could have all my music at my fingertips, be able to buy songs from the iTunes Music Store wherever there is a WiFi connection.  I would also be able to throw on a movie for the kids in the back seat while on a long road trip.  The only thing I would like to figure out is how to throw a movie on the rear displays while still being able to control the system from the front display.  It would be very nice if I could have the option of only having audio while playing movies go through headphone jacks so that we could still enjoy music through the car audio system.</p>

<p>The following are the features I want to get out of my CarPuter</p>

[styled_list style="arrow_list" variation="green"]
<ul>
    <li>Music
    <li>Movies
    <li>Wireless Internet
    <li>GPS Navigation
    <li>Satellite Radio
    <li>Regular FM / AM Radio
    <li>Remotely Start the car (not sure how to do this yet)
    <li>Automatic Climate Control (hvac)
    <li>Back-up Camera
    <li>Back-up Sensors (beeps when close to something)
    <li>Automatic headlight switching from hi/low beams with on-coming traffic
    <li>Skype Integration (have yet to look into this but seems possible)
    <li>Anything else I find interesting....
</ul>
[/styled_list]


<p>I am sure that the installation of this system will take some time and I plan to document it with pictures.  When I do this I will probably create a page on this site that will outline everything I have done with photographs for every step (that will be the most time consuming).  I have been investigating the products that I will need to buy in order to make this a reality.  I plan to spend no more than $4,000 on the parts that will be necessary to install this system.  Below is a list of parts that I know I will need.</p>

[styled_list style="arrow_list" variation="green"]
	<ul>
	<li>Mac Mini
	<li><a href="https://www.xenarcdirect.com/product.php?productid=16136&cat=249&page=1">Xenarc 7" LCD Display</a>
	<li>Screens for the headrests for the backseat passengers.
	<li><a href="http://www.usglobalsat.com/p-214-bt-359c.aspx">GlobalSat BT-359 GPS Receiver</a>
	<li><a href="http://www.carnetix.com/CNXP1900.htm">CNX P-1900 DC-DC Power Regulator</a> (Power Supply for computer)
	<li><a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark2">Griffin RadioShark 2</a> (Who wants to lose the FM / AM capabilities)
	<li><a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/powermate">Griffin PowerMate</a> (Control Wheel that will be used for volume control)
	<li><a href="https://www.fusioncontrolcentre.com/FusionStore//catalog/product_info.php?cPath=25&products_id=28">Fusion Brain</a> (Controller for back-up sensors, hi/low beams, more..)
	<li>XM Satellite Receiver & Antenna
	<li>XM to USB Converter (to connect XM Receiver to the computer)
	<li>Amplifier for interior speakers (brand not determined yet)
	</ul>
[/styled_list]


<p>I am sure that there are other products that I will be required to buy including cables, fuses, switches, sensors, etc.  There will probably also be other products that I will need to buy to incorporate more features that I wish to have.  For now though I am going with a pretty basic setup so that I can get the GPS Navigation which is my main priority.  Once I get the CarPuter installed the way I want it and running properly I will integrate things like the Fusion Brain to add more capabilities.  I like the fact that I could have my car in the driveway and be able to SSH into my car and control it.  I also like the fact that I could throw songs at my car from inside my home.  I could also integrate a backup solution for my CarPuter that would backup the entire system to a backup drive at my house every night at a certain time.  You can do anything on the CarPuter that you could do on your home computer.  Check your e-mail, browse the internet, make calls through Skype, I could even work from my car if I wanted to.</p>

<p>If you have integrated a CarPuter or just want to throw any resources my way such as articles, how-to's etc.  Please feel free to discuss it in the comments.</p>
