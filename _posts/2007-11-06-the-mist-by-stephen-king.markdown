![The Mist](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/the-mist.jpg)From the master of terror [Stephen King](http://www.stephenking.com/) comes another terrifying movie called The Mist.  I have been a long time fan of Stephen King and have read almost all of his books.  While I have not yet read this book most of the time the books are better than the movies.  I think this is going to be a tough one.  After watching the 2 trailers they have on The Mist website it looks like this movie is going to be phenomenal.  The Mist was a short story written in 1985.  I have not read this story yet so I just ordered it and look forward to reading it.  I cannot wait until the movie hits the theaters.  I usually do not go to the movies because it is so expensive these days but I think I will have to go see this movie.

[The Mist by Stephen King](http://tinyurl.com/ys8ace) looks like it will be a box office hit, head on over to [The Mist](http://tinyurl.com/ys8ace) website and watch the trailers that they have posted, they also have buddy icons, wallpapers and a screen saver that you can download.  They make the movie look so good.  There are a lot of movies that spread hype about the movie and after you watch it you sit thinking why was the preview better than the actual movie.  I doubt that will be the case with this one, Stephen King has written some really good novels which have been turned into movies.  A few of my favorites are 1408 and Rose Red.  If you have not seen those and you like scary movies then you need to do yourself a favor and go watch those as well.![](http://tinyurl.com/29d5eu)
