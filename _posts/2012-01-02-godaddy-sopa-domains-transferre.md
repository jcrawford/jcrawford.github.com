title: "Godaddy SOPA: Domains Transferred"
---
Over the last week I was in the midst of transferring my domain names from Godaddy to NameCheap.Why the change you may ask?  Rather than explain it all I will simply say I do not agree with SOPA and GoDaddy publicly announced they were for SOPA.  Now since then GoDaddy retracted the statement but it's too late in my eyes.  I cannot continue to give money to an IT company which can support such a thing.  Now that everyone is transferring domains GoDaddy is getting worried and has they have retracted the support.Need more info on [SOPA and GoDaddy](http://bit.ly/sjDw2d "Godaddy SOPA Google Search")?
