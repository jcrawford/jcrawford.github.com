[![](http://tinyurl.com/4r3wsu)](http://www.bizag.com/)I was not under the impression it was so easy to buy or sell a business these days.  Up until today I never knew there was a market for buying and selling small businesses.  I mean I know that you can sell out once your company is large and profitable, however this site I found today shows that you can sell even the smallest business.

If you are searching for a [business for sale](http://bizag.com) you should give BiZag a try.  It's a new site that offers a search engine for finding a business to purchase.  If you would like to list your business for sale you can do it there as well.  While they do charge a fee for listing your business it is quite inexpensive if you do sell the business.

I am not currently in the market for buying or selling a business however I wish I knew things like this existed before I let go of Codebowl Solutions.  It was rather profitable and I imagine I could have sold it.  Maybe in the future I will be in the market, who knows.

Sites like BiZag may be useful for those who do nothing but start up a site, then try to sell it off as a business.  Hosting businesses, Design / Programming businesses and even those get rich quick scheme sites you see out there.  I wonder how many people would buy into that garbage.
