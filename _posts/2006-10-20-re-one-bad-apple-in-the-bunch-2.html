<p>So everyone knows what trouble I am having with the Apple repair center.Â  I sent an email to Steve jobs hoping to get some attention brought to the case.Â  Obviously it is not Steveâ€™s personal email.Â  I am sure he has a bunch of people go through it and respond on his behalf.Â  A day after I sent an email requesting that my display be upgraded to the 30â€ model for the trouble I am going through, I received a response.</p><p>Before I get into this let me explain a bit more.Â  On Wednesday morning I put in the call to start the process for my 3rd repair request.Â  I was supposed to have the box arrive yesterday.Â  Nate Doss from the Apple Executive Dept. gave me a call yesterday explaining how sorry they are that this is happening.Â  They usually require the product to be repaired several times before they replace the unit (I am on my 3rd is that not enough? Not only that the repairs had to be done due to the incompetence of the techs, they keep introducing new problems.).</p><p>Nate had also notified me that the tech I spoke with the day before never finished the repair request or did something wrong so I was not going to receive the box.Â  He had to put through the request again and I would get the box Friday (today).Â  So itâ€™s another day looking at this screen that is damaged.Â  I have to continue working and getting as much as I can before I lose the display again.Â  Everyday I am working on this display I just get more and more frustrated.Â  Also it frustrates me that they will not do anything to compensate me for this.</p><!--more--><p>I have sent Nate another email last night asking why they could not do anything to keep me happy.Â  After all it is their fault that I am going through this.Â  I have yet to hear a response but when I do I will make another posting here.Â  I am at the point where fixing the original display is just not enough.Â  I could see having to send the display to repair a few times during the lifetime of the display due to parts just wearing out.Â  However when you send it in for image ghosting, and get it back with 14 dead pixels there is an issue.Â  When I sent that one back, I get this one that has 8 dead pixels, slight image ghosting AND on dark backgrounds a definite striping pattern going vertically.</p><p>This has been one frustrating experience. If Apple is not willing to compensate me for this I think my next display will be a Dell or ANYONE other than Apple.</p><p>While I stand behind Apple for their hardware I cannot stand behind a company who does not care about the customers experience and what they get back from repair.</p><p>My sole questionâ€¦.Â  WHY were these not tested properly?Â  If they were tested I wouldnâ€™t have received them in the conditions I did.</p>
