Google revealed Wednsday that it has had 50 times more requests come from the iPhone than any other mobile handset.  When they first saw the figures they thought this can't be right and had the engineers parse the logs again.  To their amazement it was correct.
  
This is nice to see as I plan on getting an iPhone in the future, I have just been waiting out all of the bugs to be found by those who could not wait to have the handset.  I am also hoping that you will be able to use the handset on any carrier and not only AT & T in the future.
  
I have seen and used the iPhone and must say that it is a great piece of hardware, very intuitive and works like a charm.
