As most of my readers know I have started to do postings for [PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g) and only post content that I feel is relevant to the site.  However one thing I wanted to share with you is that PayPerPost does more than just run the PayPerPost site.  They also run a site called [RockStartup.com](http://rockstartup.com/) [reality tv](http://www.rockstartup.com) where they post video's of things that take place while they are at work.  Things that take place can vary from meetings, to weigh-in's.  Yes you heard me right weigh-in's.  They have started a contest in the office where the person who loses the most weight get's a prize.  They are taking video and updating everyone with what is going on at PayPerPost via the RockStartup.com website.[PayPerPost](http://tinyurl.com/2xd54g) is asking all of the Postie's what their favorite episode is and I would have to say [episode 9](http://rockstartup.com/episodes/episode_9.html).  I love the fact that  Ted get's "reverse" Postie Patrolled.  I have seen video's before where they go to a Postie and have them do a scavenger hunt in exchange for a prize.  If they found everything on the list they would get the prize.  This time however a few of the Postie's visited Ted unannounced at the PayPerPost headquarters and surprised him with a treasure hunt of his own.  Gotta love it when a company creates enough buzz for users to come out and see you like that.[
