title: American Idol - The First Round
---
I am not sure why but every year I am amazed by the people who go to the show and "actually" think they are going to get passed the first round.  Tonight was just pathetic!  I mean come on, why would you go into the audition and start off with a fluttering sound like you would hear on The Jetsons.  I am not sure what is neither going through these peopleâ€™s minds nor why the staff allows them to get through to be on national TV.  I know they let them through for good ratings, I am just astonished that anyone would put themselves through that just to be the laughing stock of the country.<!--more-->Oh My...  The girl who said she loved The Wizard of Oz just had to tell everyone that and then mimic the lion.  In my opinion she sounded more like Chewbacca and would probably have a better chance getting a job where they wanted a cheap voice-over for Chewbacca.  Did she think she was going to go somewhere?  There was also he girl who said she was the biggest fan, knew everything about Idol and it was her dream to audition.  If she knew ANYTHING about Idol she would have stayed home.  She said she had a degree and that she has had 10 years of training.  I agree with the judges when they said whoever gave her that training was just there to take her money.Though the judges were right to give some people a hard time, there was the vocal coach that was not too bad; I just think it was the wrong song.  He was also an idiot for stating that he was a vocal coach before the audition.  All that is going to do is make the judges set the bar high.  My favorite though was the rocker who said Chris Daughtry opened some doors last year.  They gave him 3 chances.... THREE!  Each time he used the same over pushed raspy voice that sounded like hell.  I'm glad they closed the door on him, and they were right he needed a vocal transplant.  There is not a vocal coach out there that could help him.You may be wondering how I can sit here and talk about all of these people the way I am, being direct and to the point, it's simple.  It's not the fact that I don't know them, it's not because I side with the judges (I don't always).  It's because I know I shouldn't be there so I stay home.  If they had even recorded themselves and listened they would have stayed home.
