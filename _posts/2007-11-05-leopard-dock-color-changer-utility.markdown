I was reading TUAW and I noticed a post all about the Leopard Dock.  People have not been liking the default dock so it's a good thing that it is so easy to customize.  A utility that I found today called [Dock Color](http://www.elgebar.com/dockcolor.html) gives you the ability to change the color of your dock with a nice easy to use color wheel. Now this utility does alter system files and accidents do happen, however I have used this and it works very slick.  I would love to see a utility that would allow you to alter all aspects of the dock such as color, remove the shelf, change the indicator icons etc.  There are seperate utilities that will allow you to do different things but it would be nice to have an all in one package.
