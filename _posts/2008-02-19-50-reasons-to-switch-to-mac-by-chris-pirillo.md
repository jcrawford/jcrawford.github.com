title: 50 Reasons to switch to Mac by Chris Pirillo
---

If you are a geek like me then you must have watched TechTV's Call For Help.  This is where I first heard the name [Chris Pirillo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Pirillo "Chris Pirillo (Wikipedia)").  Chris has been known as a Windows expert and has helped a lot of people through the TV show.  On Valentines evening Chris posted an article that states [50 reasons to switch from Microsoft Windows to Mac OS X](http://chris.pirillo.com/2008/02/14/50-reasons-to-switch-from-microsoft-windows-to-apples-mac-os-x/ "40 Reasons to switch from Microsoft Windows to Mac OS X"). 
  
One of his best points is the fact that the cost comparison for Mac vs. PC is about the same.
  >   
A Mac costs about the same as a comparable Windows PC - for hardware and (for argumentâ€™s sake for those who donâ€™t believe me) bundled software. And for those who still claim that Macs are still more expensive, they obviously have never seen or priced a gaming rig. Price / cost is relative. If you want a cheap machine, thatâ€™s your prerogative. The resell value on Macs has always been higher than that of an equivalent â€œWindowsâ€ machine.â€¨â€¨
  
Everyone always seems to think that the Mac costs more and at one point I did too until I priced a PC with the same hardware as my mac pro.  Granted you could opt for cheaper hardware but you will not get the same performance.

I am glad to see that Chris made the switch and I hope he loves his Mac Pro as much as I do mine.

[Iâ€™ve said it before](http://chris.pirillo.com/2008/02/06/do-microsoft-employees-use-and-love-mac-os-x/), and Iâ€™ll say it again: Windows users need Appleâ€™s software more than Mac users need Microsoftâ€™s. Thatâ€™s just a cold, hard fact. And given my severe disappointment with just about everything in Mac Office 2008, Iâ€™m even further driven away from Microsoftâ€™s desktop software.â€¨
  
The comment above made me laugh and how true it is.  I fee the same way Chris, all the way.  As many of you may know I used Windows for 12 years but when I started using my computer for work i quickly got sick of stability issues I had with Windows and have been on the Mac platform since.  I just love that it works and the stability is very nice.
