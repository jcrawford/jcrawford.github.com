<p>So the other day i stumbled accross something called PHP-IRC, it is a full blown PHP 5 IRC Bot.&nbsp; I know there are some people out there who say now why would you use PHP for an IRC Bot.&nbsp; The more important question is WHY NOT?&nbsp; This bot is coded really well, it will work on windows, linux, mac, probably any OS that can run PHP.&nbsp; I have it loaded up and have began looking over the plugin structure and it is really nice.&nbsp; When i say this is a full blown IRC Bot i mean it.&nbsp; Some of the features are listed below.</p><p><span id="featurebox"><ul><li>DCC Chat Support with custom DCC Chat handlers</li><li>DCC File transfer support (inc. mIRC Rev. Protocol)</li><li>Modular based function support</li><li>Event based, with user-definable event handling</li><li>Full support for timers</li><li>Channel and user tracking, with user modes and count</li><li>Multiple bots under one process</li><li>Remote admin via DCC Chat or private message</li><li>MySQL support</li><li>Very in-depth documentation</li><li>... and much more!</li></ul>I am looking at making a few plugins for this bot, and will release them on this site when they are done.&nbsp; Think about the ability to have the bot store channel statistics in a database, or reach out and check your RSS Feeds for you.&nbsp; There is a lot you could do with this feature and you wouldnt have to load up a webpage to do anything, it can all be done in IRC via DCC Chat :D<br /></span></p>
