I am not sure if it is too early to start looking around for Christmas gifts, however I have already started to do that.  There are a lot of toys that my oldest son has stated "daddy I want that".  I started looking around at Toys-R-Us and creating wish lists of the items I recall him wanting.  Today I wondered if I could find any [online coupons](http://www.couponchief.com) for the stores I planned to shop at.  Usually I do not look for coupons I just buy on impulse.  I have checked out coupon sites in the past and they have all wanted me to install some proprietary software that only works on windows just to get a coupon.  Today I found [CouponChief.com](http://www.couponchief.com/) which unlike the others does not force you to install some crappy software.
  
Although I did not find too much on there that could be used for my kids, I did find a [Columbia House coupon](http://www.couponchief.com/columbiahouse) that will let me buy season 1 of House M.D. for $19.95 with free shipping.  This is a good deal considering tv shows usually got $39.99 for a season.
  
I did some more searching around and found a [Hallmark coupon](http://www.couponchief.com/hallmark) for 20% off an online order.  I think that this coupon site will be beneficial to a lot of people over this holiday season.  Why not save money when you can?  Coupons are out there for a reason, let's use them while they are there.
  
There are a lot of stores listed on the site, I would have to say a few hundred that are offering coupons.  Be sure you check out the [store listing](http://www.couponchief.com/all_merchants.html) before you go and start buying your holiday gifts this year.
