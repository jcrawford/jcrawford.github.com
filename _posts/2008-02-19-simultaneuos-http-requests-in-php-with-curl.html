<p>When you are working with remote data feeds it will definatly impact the load time of your site.&nbsp; For instance if you are using multiple curl calls to reach out to Google and Yahoo to get search results and Google takes 1 second but Yahoo takes 3 seconds it takes your application 4 seconds to load.&nbsp; Now this can add up very quickly if you are making several connections.&nbsp; The load time for your site becomes the total load time of all sites you are reaching out to.</p>  <p>What about simultaneous requests?&nbsp; Well this would make sense because the load time of your application would be as long as the call that takes the longest.&nbsp; In the example above the load time would be 3 seconds as opposed to 4 seconds.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.phpied.com/">Stoyan Stefanov</a> wrote a <a href="http://www.phpied.com/simultaneuos-http-requests-in-php-with-curl/">nice article</a> with example code showing just how to accomplish thi.&nbsp; I cannot wait to give it a shot and boost the performance of my apps.&nbsp; Thanks for pointing this out Stoyan. </p>
