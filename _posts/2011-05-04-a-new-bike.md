title: A New Bike
---
Last year I bought my first motorcycle to learn how to ride with.  It's been an amazing bike and learning to ride has been a great experience.  I love the wind in your face, all of the smells you are open to and just the overall freedom of riding.  Sure some of the fun of riding has to do with pumping adrenaline but the vast majority of riding is everything else.  When I first started I was not educated on the different types of bikes that were out there.  I went with the advice from several people who stated to get a sport cruiser style bike to learn how to ride with rather than jumping on an all out sport bike for my first bike.  I had been told that the sport cruiser bikes were more forgiving than their sport bike counterparts when it came to throttle and shifting.  I put about 5500 miles on my Katana last season and I kept the bike on the road until December 20th of last year.  I started out with a 2006 Katana 600 as pictured below with my fiance Claire seated on it.  While this bike has been a great bike to ride I wanted to step up to a sport bike rather than a sport cruiser.![](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/bike-small.jpg "2006 GSX Katana 600")Over the last year while I was looking at other bikes trying to determine which brand bike I was going to buy next I found it rather hard to determine.  When you sit on a bike for a few minutes you can easily tell if it is going to be a comfortable or uncomfortable ride for you personally.  However it's not like you can say I would like to test drive a Honda, Suzuki and Ducati.  The dealerships barely let you sit on the bikes never-mind taking them for a test ride.  I'm sure there are insurance issues so I can understand why they don't allow people to test ride.  My question has always been how am I supposed to know I like how the bike rides without riding it.  You have to buy it in order to ride it and find out you don't like it.<!--more-->Yesterday when I went to Cycles 128 to see what they had for used bikes I was actually amazed.  I asked the sales person if the one room was all they had for used bikes and he looked at me like I was crazy.  He said we are one of the largest dealers in the north east we have over 400 bikes.  He started to walk me through the back rooms after I told him I was interested in a CBR 600rr.  I was surprised they had so much stock hidden from the customers view.  How are they going to sell them if people cannot see them?After talking with them they were set to offer me $2100 for my bike this season while at the end of last season they only wanted to give me around $1500 for it.  I guess they have a lot of people every year take the riding course which are looking for their first bike.  The Katana is a very nice first bike, I have taken it on 6 hour rides and while you are a bit numb from being on the seat for that long it's still a soft comfortable seat.In the end I found the bike that I wanted and which would work for the money I had set aside along with my trade.  By the end of next week I will be the happy new owner of a 2008 CBR 600rr with only 5300 miles on it.
