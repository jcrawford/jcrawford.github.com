Today I noticed a post on the NYPHP User Group mailing list, it was a post about the unseen Saddam video.  Ofcourse out of curiosity I had to look.  This is just hilarious, I would not want to be the camera man.  Take a look for yourself and laugh untill it hurts :).  I am surprised the camera did not fall and the camera man have a heart attack.<object height="350" width="425"><param value="http://www.metacafe.com/fplayer/382178/saddam_the_unseen_video.swf" name="movie" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="350" width="425" src="http://www.metacafe.com/fplayer/382178/saddam_the_unseen_video.swf"></embed></object>
