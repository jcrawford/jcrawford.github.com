The other day my friend [Steven](http://www.degutis.org/) from [Thoughtful Tree Software](http://www.thoughtfultree.com/) released a new version of his [Inspector Framework](http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/).  This new version includes both the framework and an Interface Builder Plug-in which makes it extremely easy for you to integrate this into your own projects.After reading his [blog post](http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/) and watching the [video](http://www.degutis.org/extra/InspectorKit.mov) that he has created it looks like a very nice addition to any application that would require an inspector style window.  I might have to look at using this in my project the TomTom POI Manager.  I am not yet sure what I would use this for but surely I can find a reason to use it.<!--more-->In the comments of [Stevens](http://www.degutis.org/) [prior post](http://www.degutis.org/dev/2009/02/26/inspector-panel-for-leopard/) about the [InspectorKit](http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/) some people pointed out a [few small things](http://www.degutis.org/dev/2009/02/26/inspector-panel-for-leopard/comment-page-1/#comment-6) that should be fixed.  One of the issues was how the mouse cursor did not change when you hover over a separator as it does in Interface Builder.  [Steven](http://www.degutis.org/) has told me that he fixed this issue however this was more of an overhaul to get it into the plug-in format than anything.With [Stevens](http://www.degutis.org/) [InspectorKit](http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/) you can add an inspector panel to your application with extreme ease.  it is as simple as installing the Interface Builder Plug-in and dragging the elements into your window.  Be sure to check out the [video](http://www.degutis.org/extra/InspectorKit.mov) that [Steven](http://www.degutis.org/) has created showing just how to use the [InspectorKit](http://www.degutis.org/dev/open-source/2009/03/09/introducing-inspectorkit/).  You can download [InspectorKit 1.0 ](http://www.degutis.org/extra/InspectorKit-1.0.zip)or you can get [the source code](http://github.com/sdegutis/inspectorkit.framework/zipball/master) and mess around with that.
