Over the last few months I have been working at <a href="http://www.tattomedia.com/">Tatto Media</a> as a Software Engineer.  Unfortunately things were not working out too well and I had to provide them with my resignation.  I was able to work with some extremely talented people from several different departments and I will miss working with them.  Starting tomorrow however I will be working with the team at <a href="http://www.namespaceinc.com/">Namespace</a>.  I have missed working with this small team of people.  I am not sure what they will have me working on however I am sure that it will be interesting.
