When I was working at <a href="http://www.dailybreak.com/" title="Dailybreak" target="_blank">Dailybreak</a> I was asked to write some documentation so that the company would have this information after my departure.  They were using <a href="http://www.github.com/" title="GitHub" target="_blank">GitHub</a> for their scm so they asked that I place all of my documentation in the wiki.  The GitHub wiki supports <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown" target="_blank">Markdown</a> as a format in which you can save pages.  I quickly got up to speed with the format of Markdown and found it quite easy and very quick to write documentation with.

While testing out editors I noticed my boss was using <a href="http://www.markdownpro.com/" title="Markdown Pro" target="_blank">Markdown Pro</a>.  I went to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/markdown-pro/id465965038?mt=12" title="Markdown Pro in App Store" target="_blank">App Store</a> and saw that it cost $9.99 and was a bit hesitant to spend that much on an application which I had not yet tested out.  They do not seem to offer a demo version of the application.  After a bit of contemplating I purchased the application.

I have been using Markdown Pro for about a month now and would like to share what I have found to be the pro's and con's of Markdown Pro.  I will first start out by listing the features of the application that I love.

<ul>
<li><strong>Cheat Sheet Help</strong></li>
If you are new to Markdown and not entirely familiar with the syntax you will find the cheat sheet helpful.  You can display this by clicking the help icon in the application's header bar.  When you click this it pops down a window and nicely displays the most used syntax to guide you along.  This was very handy to me when I first started out.

<li><strong>Live Preview</strong></li>
Markdown Pro has a feature that allows you to have a split view vertically between your editor and the preview window.  You type your Markdown in the editor on the left and the preview window on the right updates in real time.  This is very nice as it allows you to detect any malformed Markdown or typo's as you are writing your document.

<li><strong>Custom Themes</strong></li>
With custom theme support you can crete your own css document and add it in the preferences window.  Doing this will allow you to choose it from the theme selector and alter what the preview of your document looks like.  This is very nice especially if you will be putting that Markdown into a website such as GitHub.  You can create the css and have your preview show you what it will look like once it's placed on the site.

<li><strong>Save to HTML / PDF</strong></li>
One of the nicest features that Markdown Pro offers is the ability to save your document to HTML or to a PDF Document.  I have tested both methods and they provide very nice results.  Having this ability allows me to export my documents to PDF and send them off to whomever needs to read them.

<li><strong>Send to Email</strong></li>
If you have ever had to collaborate when writing documents this feature will come in handy.  Once you write your Markdown you can simply click the Email button and it will put your Markdown content into the body of an email.  Address it to whomever you wish, add a subject and send it off.

<li><strong>Word Count</strong></li>
I almost did not see this feature because it was not brought to the foreground.  However there is a word counter that sits in the bottom of the application under the editor pane.  This can come in handy when you are writing documents that have a minimum or maximum word count.
	</ul>

Now that I have covered the features that I love about Markdown Pro I want to cover some things I think would make the application a "Can't Live Without" editor for Markdown.  After using Markdown for about a month I do not currently feel it was worth the $9.99 price.  If the following features were implemented it would make the price worth it to me.

<ul>
<li><strong>No Relative images in Preview or PDF Exports</strong></li>
When you are viewing the preview for your document you cannot use relative images, however you can use absolute url's to images though.  I am not quite sure why it will not evaluate relative paths but this is a MUST for me.  Now if you are using relative paths and you export to HTML your images will work just fine so long as you place the HTML document in the proper location.  You will be a bit disappointed however if you are going to do exporting to PDF as relative links to images will appear as broken image links.  Personally for my use this makes the application almost unusable, I really need to get relative image support.

<li><strong>Synchronized Scrolling</strong></li>
When you are viewing both your source and the preview window currently you have to scroll both windows individually.  It would be nice if they incorporated some sort of synchronized scrolling so that as you scrolled both windows showed the appropriate content in both views.

<li><strong>Project Support</strong></li>
I think it would be really great if Markdown Pro were to support projects.  Project support could be as simple as TextMate's support which is really just setting a folder as a project and showing all files/folders in the project.  Having this would allow for you to manage all of your Markdown files and also manage things like your CSS for the project.  It would also be very nice if Markdown Pro in project mode could detect the presence of a css/style.css file and use that for the preview mode theme selector.

<li><strong>Code Highlighting Support</strong></li>
It would also be nice if Markdown Pro incorporated some code highlighting library and highlighted the code in the preview window.  GitHub currently offers syntax highlighting once you put Markdown in place but the preview mode of Markdown does not.  When you do something like the following

	[text]
	```php
	<?php
	echo 'Hello World!';
	```
	[/text]

Markdown could detect the presence on the 'php' keyword in the line starting the code block and then highlight it accordingly by running it through the highlighting process.  While I am not entirely convinced that Markdown Pro is not worth the $9.99 price tag it might be for you.  Unfortunately you will never know unless you pay the money first.  I really really wish the App Store had the ability to support demo applications so that you could download a demo, test it out and buy it only if you like it.
