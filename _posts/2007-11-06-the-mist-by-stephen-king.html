<p align="left"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/the-mist.jpg" alt="The Mist" class="floatleft" />From the master of terror <a href="http://www.stephenking.com/">Stephen King</a> comes another terrifying movie called The Mist.&nbsp; I have been a long time fan of Stephen King and have read almost all of his books.&nbsp; While I have not yet read this book most of the time the books are better than the movies.&nbsp; I think this is going to be a tough one.&nbsp; After watching the 2 trailers they have on The Mist website it looks like this movie is going to be phenomenal.&nbsp; The Mist was a short story written in 1985.&nbsp; I have not read this story yet so I just ordered it and look forward to reading it.&nbsp; I cannot wait until the movie hits the theaters.&nbsp; I usually do not go to the movies because it is so expensive these days but I think I will have to go see this movie.</p>  <div align="left"></div>  <p align="left"><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ys8ace">The Mist by Stephen King</a> looks like it will be a box office hit, head on over to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ys8ace">The Mist</a> website and watch the trailers that they have posted, they also have buddy icons, wallpapers and a screen saver that you can download.&nbsp; They make the movie look so good.&nbsp; There are a lot of movies that spread hype about the movie and after you watch it you sit thinking why was the preview better than the actual movie.&nbsp; I doubt that will be the case with this one, Stephen King has written some really good novels which have been turned into movies.&nbsp; A few of my favorites are 1408 and Rose Red.&nbsp; If you have not seen those and you like scary movies then you need to do yourself a favor and go watch those as well.<img alt="" src="http://tinyurl.com/29d5eu" /></p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://www.themist-movie.com/"><img border="0" onmouseout="hide_disclosure_ad();ad_closed=true;" onmouseover="show_disclosure_ad(16679);ad_closed=false;" src="http://tinyurl.com/2ap5al" id="disclosure_bar_&quot;16679&quot;" alt="" /></a></p>
