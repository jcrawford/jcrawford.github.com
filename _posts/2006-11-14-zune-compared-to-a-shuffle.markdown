After watching a CNN video that TUAW linked to, I had to post it here.  It is pretty funny.  They start out talking about the features of the Zune, what it can and cannot do.  In the end they start comparing it to the new Shuffle.  The best part is when they say why can't Microsoft get any good designers for their product :)

You can read the entire story and watch the video by visiting going to the [TUAW post](http://www.tuaw.com/2006/11/14/found-footage-zune-upstaged-by-a-shuffle/ "Found Footage: Zune upstaged by a Shuffle").
