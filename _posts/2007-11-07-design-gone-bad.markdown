My friend sent me over a site tonight that we just had to laugh about.  I am not sure where he found this site but it is just insane.  [HavenWorks.com](http://www.havenworks.com/) has to be one of the worst designs I have seen in a long time.  It is way too hard to find anything between all of the flashy little icons in the page.  Now it looks bad on my 23" Apple Cinema DIsplay but it looks even worse on a 15" laptop screen.  The columns are so narrow you get 3-4 words per line.
  
With how obtrusive this site is it's a wonder that the designer has been able to live this down.  But yes it gets even better.  People actually pay this idiot to design their sites.  They have a [portfolio](http://havenworks.com/web-design/) up and while the designs are not quite as bad they are still far from even acceptable.  I cannot design myself so I stay the heck away from design and pay someone else to do it. I am not even going to post a screen shot of the site here because I do not want to effect the look of my site.  You will have to  visit the site to see just how horrid it really is.

Oh yes it gets even better.  Someone posted this on Digg as the Most Poorly Designed Website In The World.  If you look at the bottom of the HavenWorks site you see that the designer acknowledges this by planting it at the bottom of the page.
  
One might wonder how in the world something this obtrusive gets put together, well if you view the source of his page you will find this tidbit of code

This line tells us everything.  The guy is using Netscape's HTML editor to do his work, if you look at the portfolio you can see that yet again he is using it for the other designs.  I dunno but I feel with too many more people out there like this the internet just might be doomed.
