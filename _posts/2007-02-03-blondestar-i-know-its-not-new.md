title: BlondeStar (I know it's not new)

If you have heard of OnStar this is a parody for them.  I used to have OnStar in my 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix and I must say it is very useful.  We used it several times during our cross country trip.  We would be driving late at night, not have a clue where we were and we could push the button and have them reserve a hotel for us.  I kinda wish I still had it now just for the security blanket.  If I ever go off the road or am hit by another vehicle they are alerted when the air bags go off and alert the local emergency teams.Anyway take a look at [this video](http://media.funny-video-stuff.com/viewmovie.php?path=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.funny-video-stuff.com%2Fcontent%2F2007%2F02%2F02%2F1%2Fblondestar.wmv&tracking_id=617872&ad_key=LWQBWRFINXCE&type=wmv) and enjoy...
