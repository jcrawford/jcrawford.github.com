I figured since I run my own blog (and it seems like they did some work on their editor) I would give Flock another try.&nbsp; They seem to have incorporated more services and also their website seems to be redone.&nbsp; I am not sure exactly what has changed with the release of 2.0 but I am going to check it out.

Have you been using Flock?&nbsp; Can you tell me and my readers the biggest changes in 2.0?&nbsp; Please leave some comments on this if you can.
