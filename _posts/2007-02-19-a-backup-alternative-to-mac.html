<a href="http://www.ibackup.com"><img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/ib_lg_06.gif" alt="iBackup Logo" class="floatleft" border="0" /></a>I found a service today that makes a good alternative to the service .mac that Apple offers.  This service is called <a href="http://www.ibackup.com">IBackup Online Storage and Backup</a> and offers much more space for the same cost as the .mac account.  Granted you will not be able to use all the nice sync features in OS X out of the box, but I am sure that apple scripts could be written to make things as easy as possible.

With the <a href="http://www.ibackup.com/">iBackup</a> service you will get 5GB of storage space for $99.50 which is comparable to Apples $99 price tag which will get you a 1GB iDisk.  With .mac you also get email, contact sync etc. however they are a waste of money if all you wish to do is have a backup service like iBackup.  This will be my final year with .mac now that I have found this service.  I would much rather have 5GB of storage for the same price.
<blockquote>IBackup has Received several awards including PC World editor's choice(2006), consumersearch best (2007), PC Magazine editor's choice (2004) among others. IBackup Service is targeted for consumers and small businesses. While there are other offerings including free ones, what differentiates IBackup is its performance and breadth of features.</blockquote>
I am going to have to do some digging to see if you can automate things more with apple script, however they do have a mac utility that will mount your iBackup drive so that you can drag and drop to organize all of your files.  I look forward to using this service in the future it looks very very useful for my situation.

I do not want to portray that this service is only for mac users, it works for windows users also.  I am sure that it started out for windows users and they expanded to support the mac.  They have utilities for windows that will easily mount your iBackup iDrive as a network drive so that you can also drag and drop files right in windows explorer to upload and organize your files.<img src="http://www.counttrackula.com/tracker/images/3994/3108.gif" />
