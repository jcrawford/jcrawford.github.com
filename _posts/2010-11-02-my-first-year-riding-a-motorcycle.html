If you have been reading anything on my blog lately you will know that this year I went out and bought a motorcycle for me and shortly after picked one up for my fianc√© Claire.  Next season she is going to start riding with me.  This write-up is not just going to talk about how I got a bike.  I am going to go over the things that I learned the hard way so that many new riders that somehow seem to find my site will know before experiencing the same things the hard way.

	Now the first thing I must say is that through this first season I have not yet dumped the bike other than from a stand-still position trying to improperly put the bike on the center stand.  I know there are 2 types of riders... Those who have gone down and those who WILL!  I did ride and I did quite a bit of it for a first season.  So far I have put 4550 miles on the bike and I still do not plan on putting it away for the season.

	<strong>1.) Stating the obvious but WEAR THE GEAR!</strong>
	Always make sure you have on the bare essentials if not a complete suit.  I always ride with my helmet, gloves and textile jacket.  In the summer you might thing that the gloves and jacket are overkill however I need my hands.  I am a web developer and without my hands I would be completely unable to complete my job.  The jacket is the worst in the summer in my opinion.  On blazing hot 90 degree days you will be sweating quite a bit and you might be tempted to take your jacket off, in this situation I beg you to ask....  Do you really want part of your butt grafted onto your arms?  Do you want to deal with 3rd degree burns from hitting the pavement?

	<strong>2.) As A Kid I always wanted an Invisible Cloak</strong>
	I have found that you ALWAYS have to ride as if you are invisible.  The people driving cars act like you are invisible so why be left out of the game?  I am serious about this, there have been about 4 times this season that a car has almost hit me.  One of the times I was on I95 in congested traffic at a stand-still and some girl on her cell phone tried to take my spot.  I heard the tires screech and noticed she was only about 6 inches from the side of my bike.  All I could do was just shake my head

	<strong>3.) Test your Torque Wrench prior to use</strong>
	If you are going to do any routine maintenance on your bike which will require the use of a Torque Wrench you can do yourself a favor and test it on something before you use it on your bike.  I am new to torque wrenches and when it came time to do my oil change on my bike I went out and bought all the necessary supplies.  Oil Pan, Oil, Oil Filter, Torque Wrench, Funnel.  I then set off to do what I thought was going to be a quick and easy oil change.  I took the bike for a ride to warm up the oil and then proceeded to remove the drain plug.  All was going fine, the plug fell into the oil pan as always and I let the oil drain.  After about 45 minutes I noticed it was not dripping oil anymore so I cleaned up the mess and pulled the drain plug out of the old oil and cleaned it up.  I then reached for the torque wrench and my iPad (I have my service manual on it) and started to read on the torque settings for the drain plug.  My bike stated it was 16 ft lbs. of pressure for the drain plug.  I continued to set the torque wrench at 15 ft lbs. and went on my way.  In about the 3rd turn of the plug I felt it tighten up then instantly go loose.  I knew what this meant and I was not happy about it.  I just stripped the plug.  I looked at a few ways to fix this issue, first I had a friend who said he could weld a nut to the inside of the pan so that the bolt would have something to grip onto.  I pursued this option and it would have worked except the bolt came off the pan when I tightened it.  I then had to order another oil pan which I opted to get from a salvage yard as it was in almost pristine condition and it saved me about $100.  While putting the new oil pan on I came to find that I needed a gasket to go between the oil pan and the engine.  I also found that the bolts used to hold the oil pan on are Torque to Yield which I guess means they can only be used one.  When I tried to put one of them back into the bike the threads separated and the bolt snapped, thankfully not inside the engine as I was able to get a hold of it with pliers and unscrew it.  I went to the bike shop and found that I had to order all of these and wait a week to get them.  Once I got all of the parts I found that I had to take my manifold off of the engine block as the exhaust ran underneath my oil pan, there was no way to remove the oil pan without first removing the entire exhaust system.  I removed the manifold and also removed the header gaskets and set them aside.  I removed the oil pan and installed the new one.  Before I put the entire manifold back onto the machine I put the drain plug in place and filled it with oil.  I made sure there were no leaks before continuing.  I then went ahead and put the manifold back together and put all the plastics on (mistake).  I fired it up and was instantly surprised by smoke coming out of my headers.  I tore everything apart again and found that I had improperly put the manifold o-ring gaskets in place, I had crushed them so I had to order new ones.  I got the new ones and installed them and have had no problems.  All in all my oil change cost me around $200.

	<strong>4.) Never use your breaks or shift when in a lean</strong>
	I had read everywhere that you should not break while your bike is leaned over doing so could cause your tire to slide out from under you ending up with you hitting the ground.  While I did not have any scares while breaking I did while shifting though it was all my fault.  The issue took place when I was heading to work one day and when I got onto I95 there was absolutely no cars coming up behind me.  I wanted to get up to speed and get to the fast lane so that I could cruise to work so I hammered it in first gear and before red-line I had hit 50 mph, I then shifted to second gear and when I looked down I was doing 70.  At this time I was leaned to the right because I was going in a corner but also getting back to the center of the lane.  I shifted to third and this was a mistake because I was over-revved for second gear and after I shifted I did not give it enough gas.  When I went into third gear the engine was still revving high so the engine caught and tried to slow the bike down.  I felt the bike literally try to throw me off like a bull would.  I had no time to think and therefore do not take credit for my actions, rather I feel lucky about them.  When I first felt the bike start to throw me I quickly threw all of my weight to the right and hammered down on the throttle.  These actions were what kept me from going down but as I said it was ALL luck and not experience.

	<strong>5.) Watch those corners.</strong>
	A few weeks ago I went to one of my friends houses in NH and while down here in the city the streets were clean in Derry NH they were a mess from gravel, acorns, remnants from the 4th of July fireworks just laying in the street.  I went into a left hand corner and started to feel the bike slipping out from under me.  My body reacted and my left foot went down to the ground and stomped as quick as it could.  This kicked the bike back up into a more gradual lean and allowed me to keep from hitting the ground.

	<strong>6.) Clean and Lube your chain regularly</strong>
	Especially if your bike is sitting outside in the weather like mine currently is.  Every-time it rains run down and care for the chain.  If you don't you will end up with surface rust actually starting to eat your chain.  I will be replacing my chain next season for this reason alone.  I did clean my chain after every rain but I waited hours rather than running right down and getting it taken care of.

	<strong>7.) Riding with others</strong>
	When you are riding with other people no matter how many bikes there are always ride in a staggered formation so that you are not following right behind another rider.  Should they have to hit their brakes or anything you are in-line for a crash.  Always, Always, Always be on guard.  Over the Summer I was taking a ride up to Hampton Beach with about 5 bikes.  Right near the Cumberland Farms at the intersection of Lynnfield St and Boston St. another rider was going to overtake my position.  I was on the right and he was on the left.  However I did not see just how close he was and as he hit the throttle I leaned to the left to avoid an obstruction in the road.  We almost collided, I was able to keep the bikes from hitting each other but they were literally inches apart while doing 40 mph.  Our legs touched each other but the bikes remained apart.  So always ride cautiously and when you are riding in a group.... DON'T try to overtake someone else's position without any warning anything can happen.

	<strong>8.) Expect to go down</strong>
	Don't ever think you are not going to hit the ground.  Just look at all the motogp riders out there who go down every day.  The day you think you wont eat asphalt will be the day you push the bike further than your limits and you WILL hit the ground.  Always be prepared, know that anytime you hit that seat it may be your last.
