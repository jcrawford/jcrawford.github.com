So on Monday (10/09/06) I had to ship my 23" Apple Cinema Display into repair.  There was an issue with the image burning into the screen, when I was in full screen mode I could see a ghost image of the menu bar.  Up to this point all was going well.  I sent it out and received it back very quickly. I was actually surprised that I got it back today (10/11/06).  I was very excited to finally have the display back, i set it up immediately and checked to make sure my issue was fixed.  The way I checked was that I loaded up a screen saver with a solid black image.  Sure enough my issue was gone, however I noticed something else.  There were about 5 dead pixels that were very noticeable.  I checked the repair sheet and it says that they replaced the LCD module.

As you can imagine I was not very happy, I immediately called Apple Support.  They went through their routine of talking with the product specialist and even the tech couldn’t believe that I received it back from repair in this condition.  While I was on hold I did a much finer inspection and found there to be 14 dead pixels scattered across the screen.  After a while I was on the phone with the actual product specialist and they apologized up and down saying that they would make sure that it was fixed properly this time.  This was not acceptable as they introduced this new issue when they obviously used a defective LCD panel.  From my point of view accidents happen, BUT this could have easily been avoided had they tested the display AT ALL they would have noticed these.  Whomever the tech was that worked on my display needs to take a bit more time and go over the issue, make sure it's fixed and that they don’t introduce something as blatantly obvious as this.

I am not very happy that I have to be without my display for ANOTHER 3-5 days, I just hope they fix it right this time.  I DO NOT want to have to return it yet again.  Also one thing that bothers me (doesn't really anger me) is the fact that they screwed up and they didn’t offer anything in return.  Most companies will offer you something free when they make a mistake like this.  I guess they don’t do that.
