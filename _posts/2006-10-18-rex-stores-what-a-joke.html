<p>So a while back I went to the local Rex Electronics store here in Rutland, VT.&nbsp; I was looking to buy a 32&quot; LCD TV for use as my television but also as my computer display.&nbsp; It would allow me to use a wireless mouse and keyboard and work from my couch.&nbsp; I was looking for one that had a DVI input on the back since my video card was DVI.&nbsp; I went into the local store and the store looked empty, I mean I didn&rsquo;t see anyone.&nbsp; I just started to look around at the TV's and then I noticed a sales associate sitting in a chair watching the football game on one of the big screen TV's.&nbsp; I walked around a bit more, making sure he noticed me in the store.&nbsp; Finally I went up and asked him if it would be disturbing his game to get some assistance, he said no and came over to me. </p><p>I told him that I was looking to buy an LCD with DVI inputs and he told me that they had none.&nbsp; As I was walking out of the store I found it hard to believe that none of the 30+ TV's they had offered DVI so I looked at about 3 on my way out.&nbsp; All 3 of them had the connector that I needed.&nbsp; Later that week I went back in to look for a surround sound system.&nbsp; I planned on buying both around the same time.&nbsp; I spoke with the same sales associate and asked how many watts a particular system was.&nbsp; He went in the back room to check the owner&rsquo;s manual.</p><!--more--><p>About 5 minutes later he came back out from the back room, and instantly started talking with another customer and helping them rather than returning to help me.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t believe it; he either forgot what he was doing within the 5-minute window or he was blatantly ignoring me.</p><p>Now it's not like I am a frequent visitor to this store and I am not in there always having them do work / research without buying anything.&nbsp; I could understand this treatment in that situation.&nbsp; I immediately started to seek out the manager of the store.&nbsp; I waited while he finished with his customer and then I notified him of the situation that I had with the particular sales associate.&nbsp; The manager really did not care; his response was &quot;Well it's his loss, now he doesn't get the commission.&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn't believe that was his response, I said well no it's the stores loss because he just lost the store about $3,000 in sales.&nbsp; He apologized and said well if you change your mind I will give you a 10% discount.&nbsp; After that reaction from the manager I told him that I do not deserve to be treated like I was, and would not return for the purchase no matter what the discount was.</p><p>After dealing with the manager I did not have the energy to contact corporate, I could not handle any more incompetent people.&nbsp;</p><p>I did not end up buying the LCD TV because I purchased the Power Mac G5 with the 23&quot; ACD as the LCD TV's did not have the resolution that I required, however I did purchase an $800 sound system.&nbsp; I have not been to the store since and I doubt that I will ever return to that store.&nbsp; The customer service was horrible and there are other electronics stores in the area and even if there was not there is always eBay or online.</p>
