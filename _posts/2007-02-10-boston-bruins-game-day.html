Well for Christmas I bought my girlfriend front row seats to go see a Bruins game.Â  The day is finally here and we cannot wait.Â  Front row is going to be amazing and I will be sure to get some pictures to post on here.Â  After the game we are going to get a hotel and then check out the night-life over by the marina.Â  We have been wanting to go to a few of the bars down near broad st.Â  One such is Jose McIntyre's which we have walked passed several times when we had the kids with us in Boston.Â  We are hoping to have a blast tonight and I will be sure to have some pictures soon.
