<img src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/firefox.jpg" alt="FireFox Mascot" class="floatleft" />Someone has actually taken that serious and modified their pet to be the FireFox mascot.  I would love to have a pet like this maybe I should run out and buy one :D  This is definitely some clever thinking and I would love to be able to see the pet in real life and actually pet the animal.  I wonder what the group behind FireFox thinks about this.  It kind of makes me wonder what the dog looked like before the modification and how difficult the dog was during the process.  I would imagine that this was not a 5 minute task but rather it probably took several hours.  It is a beautiful dog and looks so friendly, I wonder if it can run as fast as FireFox lol.

Maybe this picture should be on the front page of their website lol.  Good job on the modification and props to whomever did this, I wonder what an IE mascot would look like heh.  Someone should put this on eBay I am sure they could make millions lol let me customize your pet to look like your favorite browser.  I think i see a new business opportunity for Paris Hilton hehe.  If you are the owner of this pet please contact me, I would like to get to know more about the pet and what exactly was going through your mind when you did this lol.  I wonder if i could make our Parrot look like this.... *light-bulb* goes off.  My girl would kill me if I touched the bird...  That is if the bird did not kill me first, she's not that friendly.
