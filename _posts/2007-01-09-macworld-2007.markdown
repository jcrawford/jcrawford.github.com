If you have not been paying attention, well shame on you.  Today is the day for MacWorld 2007.  It all starts in about an hour and I will not be covering it live on the site.  However if you get over to the IRC channel on [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/#mwsf2007) and join [#mwsf2007](irc://irc.freenode.net/#mwsf2007) you can catch all of the news in 1 spot.  Would you rather watch 20 RSS Feeds or watch 1 LIVE IRC channel where people are reporting what is going on in just 1 place.I will be reporting the posts on TUAW to the IRC channel.  Come join us and have some fun ;)  There are currently 437 people watching the channel and 142 people talking in the discussion channel [#mwsf2007-discuss](irc://irc.freenode.net/#mwsf2007-discuss).  I hope to see you over on the IRC channel.I will be making a few posts on here later in the day once I am done reporting to the IRC channel for those who are unable to keep up with things as they happen live.To get on the IRC channel you can use a few IRC clients if you are on windows I would suggest Klient or mIRC.  If you are on the Mac you can use Xchat.
