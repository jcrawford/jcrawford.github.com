title: Going Back to Namespace
---
Over the last few months I have been working at [Tatto Media](http://www.tattomedia.com/) as a Software Engineer.  Unfortunately things were not working out too well and I had to provide them with my resignation.  I was able to work with some extremely talented people from several different departments and I will miss working with them.  Starting tomorrow however I will be working with the team at [Namespace](http://www.namespaceinc.com/).  I have missed working with this small team of people.  I am not sure what they will have me working on however I am sure that it will be interesting.
