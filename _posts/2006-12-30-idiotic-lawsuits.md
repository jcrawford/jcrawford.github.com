title: Idiotic Lawsuits

People sometimes make me wonder how they survive in life.  They make some decisions that go against common sense and they end up getting injured or injuring someone else.  Many people wonder why people do the stupid things they do and I think it is all related to how something is portrayed to them.  Most of the media tends to add a disclaimer to any advertisements that are not real, or that are dangerous to try.

My step-father was telling me today about a guy who bought a top of the line RV, set cruise control and stepped away to go to the bathroom.  Obviously the RV crashed before the guy made it to the bathroom.  He sued the company and got millions (I am not sure but I think the commercial may have implied that it was an auto pilot).  After seeing the new H3 commercial on TV I started wondering how long it would take before someone attempted the same thing with the H3.  If you have not seen the video you can watch it below.
<!--more-->> the guy sued because he set the cruise control and walked to the back of the RV, which resulted in the RV crashing. I hate to tell you this, but that story is an absolute lie. It is an urban myth.
If you go to [this page](http://www.corpreform.com/corpreform/2003/10/the_myth_of_the.html) you will find more about the RV incident.  Some are saying that it is a myth and others are saying it is true.  Both parties supplied links to debate their reasons but when I went to them they are both not found.  The newspaper one might be real but it is moved to the paid archives.  The other link about the myth was just a not found page.

Keep in mind that this commercial is un-edited.  You can see the same one on the Hummer website or on your TV.  Why do they not put a small disclaimer at the bottom of the screen stating this is not real?  They are just asking for a lawsuit.  Maybe I should go test drive one and test out this feature?  I know it's a bit lame but with the way the world is today, someone "could" do that and actually sue them and WIN!
