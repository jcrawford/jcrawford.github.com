title: Everyone could use some time management
---
I know when I started going to the University of Phoenix Online they had me take a [time management](http://www.timethoughts.com/time-management.htm) course, it proves that everyone could benefit from a little [time management](http://www.timethoughts.com/time-management.htm) training.  Learn how to best use your time and not waste time.  Myself for instance would be wasting time if I were sitting here not being productive on my site, during the day I would not be managing my time accordingly if I were browsing blogs while at work.I ran into this site tonight that sheds quite a bit of light on time management.  If you think you could use your time a bit wiser to accomplish more and not waste so much time, you should take a look.  You would not believe how much time is wasted every day by just about everyone.I personally know that I used to waste a lot of my time during the day.  Taking the course at the University was a lot of help to me.  However reading this guide was a refresher and makes me want to put my boot behind me and go.
