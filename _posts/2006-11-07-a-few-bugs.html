<p>There have been a few slight bugs in the new layout, please bear with us while we get them all ironed out.&nbsp; We are also planning to make many more changes to this site in the future as we add custom features to the site.&nbsp; Although I do not think I will be adding much more to the front page, it will really start to look cluttered if I do.&nbsp; There may be a few bumps in the coming week or so but after that it should be back to normal.</p><p>We hope you enjoy the layout.</p>
