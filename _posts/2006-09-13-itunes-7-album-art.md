title: iTunes 7 Album Art
---

I have to say the album art is a nice feature on iTunes 7 however one thing that i do not like is that they say it will add the art to all albums whether or not you bought it on the iTMS.  I tried to add Elton John - Peachtree Road and Blues Traveler - Live on the Rocks, neither of which can be found on iTMS.  I am guessing they only support the music that they sell for the cover art and am dissapointed that not all albums could be gathered like this.  I guess we are stuck updating the album art which iTunes cannot find manually.
