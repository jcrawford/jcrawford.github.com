I do apologize for the delay, I started working on this article a while back and life's obstacles jumped in the way.  Take some time to go over the article and leave some comments letting me know what you think of it.  It focuses on a custom session handler that will store the session data in a database, it also implements some security.You can find the article on my [PHP Articles](http://www.josephcrawford.com/php-articles/ "PHP Articles") page, let me know what you think.
