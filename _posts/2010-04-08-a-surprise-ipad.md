title: A Surprise iPad
---
Yesterday while at work my fianc√© called me and told me that she was buying me an iPad for my birthday.  I must say that I am quite impressed how fast the device is.  I must also state that i love how fast you can actually type on the device without any lag or delay in the typing speed.  As i am writing this i am trying to type as fast as i can and to my amazement it is almost as fast as on a regular keyboard and there have been very minimal mistakes.My only real disappointments with the device Is the lack of a front facing camera for use with video conferencing.  The other slight drawback is the fact that iBook does not support PDF documents.  For that I have found GoodReader which fills the gap.  It would be very nice however if iBook actually supported PDF since there are really no converters that I have found which actually work.  I am not Trying to convert the typical book with only text.  I am trying to convert books like "Head First Php& MySQL" which contains a lot of images.  When i convert a pdf book which has 300 pages it is converted into a malformed ePub as file with about 3000 pages.<!--more-->If there is one thing that apple has done right with all of these devices it's the app store.  I have found that over the first few days of ownership i have spent about $100 on apps.  Yes developers you are welcome :)I love how Conceited Software is on top of things and has already released a version of Linkinus for the iPad.there is one minor bug that i have found but i am not sure yet if it is a bug with the Spell checking of with the word press app that i am using to write this.  The issue is when you miss-spell a word it is underlined red.z. When you tap this work spelling suggestions are shown in blue bubles above the word, tapping on the word you wish to use does not actually change the miss-spelled word.Another bug with the Wordpress app is if you are writing a post and you tap the gear icon at the top of the screen you can change the published date.  If you set the date and then hit save you are taken back to the main screen but the dialog about the published date remains on the screen.
