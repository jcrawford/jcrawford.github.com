I am unable to attend this event as are many others in the world, however this day in age it does not mean you have to miss out.  This year there is a dedicated IRC channel that you can join and keep an eye on whatever is said, what is released, and chat with a lot of others (currently 176 but bound to grow).You can jump on the IRC channel now and start talking to everyone about what you are hoping will be announced.  With so many rumours floating about I am sure something good will come of it.  People are already on the channel discussing whether they think the iPhone will be announced or not.  Come on over and give us your opinion on the subject.<!--more-->If you are interested in being a geek during the conference tomorrow get on [irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net/#mwsf2007) and join the channel [#mwsf2007](irc://irc.freenode.net/#mwsf2007).  If you are not as much of a geek as I am you can always wait a few hour for the keynote video to be uploaded to the internet.  There will be someone on the IRC channel with the nickname SteveJobs who will be relaying everything to the channel.I really wish Apple introduces the iPhone (we know it wont be named that but whatever) and I hope it is similar to the Treo family.  Something with a built in keyboard and decent sized screen.  I think it would be really tough to use a phone that had a scroll wheel like the iPod ;)<div>{democracy:5}</div>
