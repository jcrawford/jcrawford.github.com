<p><img width="203" height="380" src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/photo-42.jpg" alt="Broken Arm" class="floatleft" />Friday night I went to see my boys and we went to McDonalds in Rutland.&nbsp; I was too big to take Paxton into the play place tunnels so my girl Claire took him in.&nbsp; They were in a glass bubble so I pulled myself up onto one of the bars so that he could see me and I could make him laugh.&nbsp; I was there for a few minutes and then decided to hop down, when I did my arm caught on one of the bars that went to a T and I heard &quot;crack&quot;.&nbsp; My fingers started to tingle so I said we have to go to Claire.&nbsp; She thought we were getting kicked out for her being in the tunnels.&nbsp; When I told her that I broke my arm she thought I was joking.&nbsp; The guy that was sitting about 30 feet away confirmed to her that he heard it break.&nbsp; I went to the ER and they confirmed that it was broken.&nbsp; I broke the big bone in my forearm on the inside near my thumb.&nbsp; I have it in a splint, I wouldn't let them cast it because the cast would not allow me to type because it goes over your knuckles.&nbsp; If I cannot type I cannot work and well I need to work.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The doctor that saw me looked at my x-ray and said that I needed to go see an orthopedic surgeon to have surgery.&nbsp; He said they were going to wrap the bone with a metal plate.&nbsp; I am not going to do that.&nbsp; I already have one metal plate on my collar bone from a car accident and in the winter I really feel the cold weather.&nbsp; I looked at the x-ray and it looks like a small fracture, I think they just want to bump up the bills hehe.</p>
