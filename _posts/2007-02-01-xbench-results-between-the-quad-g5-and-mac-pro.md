title: Xbench Results between the Quad G5 and Mac Pro
---
A while back I mentioned that I got the new Mac Pro and that I would be showing some benchmarking between the Quad G5 and Mac Pro.  I have completed the benchmarking and testing of the Mac Pro and I really do have to say that I think it is close to being twice as fast as the Quad G5.  I have been ripping my DVD library to my computer getting prepared for Apple TV.  On the G5 it would take an hour and twenty minutes to rip and encode the movie in H.264 quality.  On the new Mac Pro it takes only 45 minutes per movie.   While I do not run Photoshop on a daily basis I borrowed a friends copy of CS2 so that I could compare the performance.  Photoshop CS2 definitely runs faster on the PowerPC processor, however I did not find that it was too slow to work with.I really love the new Mac Pro and look forward to utilizing it for the years to come.<!--more-->_**Quad G5 Results **_Results    114.54System InfoXbench Version        1.3System Version        10.4.8 (8L127)Physical RAM        4096 MBModel        PowerMac11,2Processor        PowerPC G5x4 @ 2.50 GHzL1 Cache        64K (instruction), 32K (data)L2 Cache        1024K @ 2.50 GHzBus Frequency        1 GHzDrive Type        WDC WD2500JS-41MVB1CPU Test    149.09GCD Loop    114.73    6.05 Mops/secFloating Point Basic    168.11    3.99 Gflop/secAltiVec Basic    330.03    13.15 Gflop/secvecLib FFT    132.07    4.36 Gflop/secFloating Point Library    120.90    21.05 Mops/secThread Test    250.03Computation    252.81    5.12 Mops/sec, 4 threadsLock Contention    247.30    10.64 Mlocks/sec, 4 threadsMemory Test    140.24System    132.61Allocate    128.64    472.42 Kalloc/secFill    194.99    9481.00 MB/secCopy    102.88    2124.89 MB/secStream    148.79Copy    146.01    3015.79 MB/sec [G5]Scale    144.96    2994.86 MB/sec [G5]Add    150.59    3207.88 MB/sec [G5]Triad    153.96    3293.52 MB/sec [G5]Quartz Graphics Test    111.31Line    104.19    6.94 Klines/sec [50% alpha]Rectangle    106.70    31.86 Krects/sec [50% alpha]Circle    107.66    8.78 Kcircles/sec [50% alpha]Bezier    118.14    2.98 Kbeziers/sec [50% alpha]Text    122.02    7.63 Kchars/secOpenGL Graphics Test    73.64Spinning Squares    73.64    93.42 frames/secUser Interface Test    150.89Elements    150.89    692.52 refresh/secDisk Test    70.98Sequential    100.90Uncached Write    116.56    71.56 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Write    106.29    60.14 MB/sec [256K blocks]Uncached Read    74.93    21.93 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Read    120.36    60.49 MB/sec [256K blocks]Random    54.75Uncached Write    21.07    2.23 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Write    131.25    42.02 MB/sec [256K blocks]Uncached Read    92.68    0.66 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Read    138.80    25.76 MB/sec [256K blocks]_**Mac Pro Results**_Results    151.51System InfoXbench Version        1.3System Version        10.4.8 (8N1250)Physical RAM        4096 MBModel        MacPro1,1Drive Type        WDC WD2500JS-41SGB0CPU Test    137.54GCD Loop    313.84    16.54 Mops/secFloating Point Basic    151.67    3.60 Gflop/secvecLib FFT    108.77    3.59 Gflop/secFloating Point Library    98.93    17.23 Mops/secThread Test    522.67Computation    475.37    9.63 Mops/sec, 4 threadsLock Contention    580.44    24.97 Mlocks/sec, 4 threadsMemory Test    127.40System    123.96Allocate    141.35    519.10 Kalloc/secFill    116.68    5673.49 MB/secCopy    116.86    2413.60 MB/secStream    131.03Copy    126.82    2619.50 MB/secScale    128.45    2653.84 MB/secAdd    135.40    2884.25 MB/secTriad    133.84    2863.13 MB/secQuartz Graphics Test    163.84Line    155.82    10.37 Klines/sec [50% alpha]Rectangle    190.19    56.78 Krects/sec [50% alpha]Circle    187.16    15.26 Kcircles/sec [50% alpha]Bezier    171.18    4.32 Kbeziers/sec [50% alpha]Text    130.58    8.17 Kchars/secOpenGL Graphics Test    173.41Spinning Squares    173.41    219.99 frames/secUser Interface Test    384.01Elements    384.01    1.76 Krefresh/secDisk Test    68.06Sequential    96.59Uncached Write    86.30    52.99 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Write    104.65    59.21 MB/sec [256K blocks]Uncached Read    82.96    24.28 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Read    121.73    61.18 MB/sec [256K blocks]Random    52.53Uncached Write    19.85    2.10 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Write    128.33    41.08 MB/sec [256K blocks]Uncached Read    91.71    0.65 MB/sec [4K blocks]Uncached Read    141.43    26.24 MB/sec [256K blocks]
