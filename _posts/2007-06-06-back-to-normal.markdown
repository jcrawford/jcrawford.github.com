Hey everyone.  It has been quite a while since my last post and I wanted to let everyone know that things would be back to normal very soon.  I have been in the midst of relocating to NY.  I have also been very busy with work @ [ERE](http://www.ere.net/).  We have been doing a lot of pretty cool things with CodeIgniter and JQuery on the new ERE website that we are creating.I have also been having to work with an attorney to fight for my fair share of time with my kids.Â  I am hoping that once things are squared away with the kids things will start to seem normal again.Â  I miss the kids so much and cannot wait to take them on the weekends.Anyway I promise that things will be back to normal and there will be content posted on here on a regular basis.
