excerpt: I was recently in contact with a recruiter who thought that I was unprofessional and/or that I did not appreciate all the hard work they put in for me during a previous job search, they also implied that I was not acting in a professional manner because their clients expect them to represent the most professional developers.

I was recently in contact with a recruiter who thought that I was unprofessional and/or that I did not appreciate all the hard work they put in for me during a previous job search, they also implied that I was not acting in a professional manner because their clients expect them to represent the most professional developers.If ANY of you that have personally worked with me feel this way in the very least "I am sorry." please reach out to me personally and I will clear this up any way possible.  I personally feel that I have always acted professionally when dealing with *anyone* not only recruiters or potential employers.I was also informed that I was ignoring their emails and or not responding to them at all.  I actually went through my sent items and found that I in-fact did reply to them and they may have missed the message on their end.  If you think that I have not replied to any of your emails I am *not* intentionally ignoring you, I am sure I sent a reply.  Please reach out to me and we can clear this up.Thank You,Joseph Crawford
