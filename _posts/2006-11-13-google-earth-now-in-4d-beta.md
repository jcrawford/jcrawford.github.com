title: Google Earth now in 4D (beta)
---

The development team has increased the performance of Google Earth and have also made it possible to travel back in time.  For instance you can take a look at San Francisco in 1946 to see what the city looked like back then.  Do not expect high resolution quality images if you travel back in time.  Google developers can do a lot but they cannot pull off miracles with photography that is years old.

This beta version looks very nice and is as easy to use as the previous version.
