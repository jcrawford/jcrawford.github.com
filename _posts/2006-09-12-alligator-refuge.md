title: Alligator Refuge
---

In 2001 we took a trip around the country, we stopped in many places, however the one place that interested me the most was just a few minutes from Savannah Georgia.  It is actually South Carolina but is named the Savannah Alligator Refuge.  I am not sure if they have crocodiles there as well or if it is only alligators.  I am not an expert so i do not know the different really.  What i do know is that we drove our car through the back roads and there were many places where i wouldnt have ever thought of getting out of the car.  At one point we had about a 12-14ft alligator only about 15 feet from our car, they are everywhere and there are no fences.  If you are ever in that area, you should go and check it out, beware though that there are no fences and you are at your own risk.  It was such fun.  We are looking to move to the Savannah area sometime this year and i cannot wait to go back to see the gators :D 

I wonder if the Steve Irwin ever went here to talk about the animals.  I know he dealt with more than just Crocodiles.
