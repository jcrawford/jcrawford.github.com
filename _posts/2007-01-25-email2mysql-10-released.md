title: eMail2MySQL 1.0 Released

Today i was browsing the web and I came accross [GeekSuit](http://geeksuit.com/ "GeekSuit").Â  On their website they have a php script that will connect to a pop email box and import the emails into an MySQL database.Â  The script comes with a rather nice GUI.Â  I could see someone using this script to setup a free web based email service.Â  People would register for the site and this script would run on a cron job to monitor a catch all email box.When the script runs it would check the to email address and see if it matches any of the current members, if it does it would do the import.Â  If free email services were not popping up all over the net this would be a great addition to the world wide web.Â  However they are just about everywhere and some such as [GMail](http://www.gmail.com/ "Google Mail") even offer close to 3GB of storage space.One web based email application that seems to get great reviews is [HiveMail](http://www.hivemail.com/ "HiveMail").Â  You can theme it just like you would vBulleting (popular forum application) and you can even integrate the 2 applications.Â  While HiveMail is not free there are several open source solutions for web based email as well.Â  [SquirrelMail](http://www.squirrelmail.org/ "SquirrelMail"), [Horde](http://www.horde.org/webmail/ "Horde Mail"), many more.
