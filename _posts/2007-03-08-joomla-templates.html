Over the last few years I have been looking more and more into frameworks and ways to easily start up a site with very little effort.  If you are wanting to build a website based on a framework I would highly suggest Joomla.  Getting used to Joomla will take some time and it will definitely take some time to learn how to extend it and customize the templates.  It's a good thing that there is a lot of documentation out there that will help you extend the framework and get things up and running.  I did come across <a href="http://clubtvk.com/" title="ClubTVK">ClubTVK</a> which offers a lot when it comes to <a href="http://www.clubtvk.com">Joomla Templates</a>.

They are offering a kit for $45.99 that gives you a 91 page e-book that will get you up to speed on how to create your own templates.  If you have experience with Joomla then this kit is not for you.  It is an absolute beginners guide that assumes you know nothing about Joomla templates.  They also give you 6 templates with step by step instructions and then access to  44 more that do not contain instructions but that you can use if you wish.  That's a total of 50 templates to pick and choose from.  You can also look over the code and read the instructions, get familiarized with the framework.<img src="http://www.counttrackula.com/tracker/images/2847/3108.gif" />
