<p>So I was finally able to install the new Leopard and I must say that so far I am loving it.&nbsp; Now is it worth the big fuss Apple put up about it?&nbsp; Probably not to the average user.&nbsp; I know this is not the first review of leopard as I was not inclined to test out the beta's however I know it won't be the last either.&nbsp; Right now I have TimeMachine doing the initial backup and contrary to what everyone says you do not need an external drive to work with it.&nbsp; I have a spare internal drive that I set as the backup drive and it is working just fine.&nbsp; They have updated the dock to allow for stacks which are nice if you need to get at something quickly.</p>  <p>Overall I have to say that I do not regret upgrading however there are a few apps that I use that I had to do some digging to get them to work.&nbsp; Visor a well known terminal application (which is just a SIMBL plug-in really) would not work with the Terminal.app that comes with Leopard.&nbsp; The work around was to keep a copy of the 10.4 Terminal.app and use that.&nbsp; I finally got that working and love the fact that I have it.&nbsp; Spending so much time in terminal it's nice to have something like this.</p>  <p>Menufela is another app that I use.&nbsp; This just hides the menu-bar at the top of the screen.&nbsp; People have argued that there is no point in doing this but I find that it helps me with a bit more screen real estate and also saves my display from Image Persistence.&nbsp; I do not yet see a work around for this but I will be on the lookout.</p>  <p>Spaces seems nice but then again nothing beats a dual display setup sorry guys ;)</p>  <p>One thing that I am amazed with is the fact that I ordered it yesterday and even though FedEx said 5 days delivery it was here at 8:30 this morning.&nbsp; Talk about a fast transaction.</p>
