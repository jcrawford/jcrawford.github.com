If you are from the Albany, NY surrounding area you might be happy to hear that [Albany PHP](http://www.albanyphp.org/) has opened it's doors.  They seem to be really new and so the user base is still small, however I feel that no matter how small the group there is always a wealth of information that you can pick from them.  Head on over whether you are local or not and take part on the forums.I am also a proud member of the NY PHP User Group and remain to be a member there.  I will always venture down as many avenues as possible, that's the only way to gain exposure for yourself, help as many people as possible and even get help in the times you need it.This is great contribution from Edward Prevost for the PHP community and I look forward to being part of this community.
