<p>Recently I have been getting more and more into Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X.  I have become attached to the syntax of Obj-C.  If you are also just starting to learn how to develop applications for OS X and would like someone to work with hit me up.  I could always use someone to answer questions for me and also someone who can use the knowledge I do have so that I may help you as well.</p>

<p>Programming for OS X takes an approach that I am not quite used to.  You spend most of your time pointing and clicking rather than writing code which I am used to coming from a PHP background.  I am not yet sure what I will write for my first application, I am actually still going through the new Hilligass book which is quite good in my opinion.</p>
