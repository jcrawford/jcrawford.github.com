title: Get A Mac Parodies
---

This morning I was watching a few parodies on the cult of mac.  Most of them were done by amateurs who in my opinion did a good job making the movies but...  The movies were just stupid for the most part.  Really the only one I found to be funny was one that used true Get A Mac footage and created a Brokeback Mountain parody.  The best Get A Mac commercial spoofs I have found were the ones on the TruTV website.  They were humerous and very good quality.

 

There is a defenite battle going on between Mac and PC and well..  Get over it Mac is just dominant :D  Well now I cannot say that because I do wish my G5 was a Mac Pro so that I could play games.
