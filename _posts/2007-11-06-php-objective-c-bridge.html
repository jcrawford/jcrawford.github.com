<p>For those of you out there who don't want to learn yet another language but still want to develop for the OS X platform you are in luck.&nbsp; <a href="http://netevil.org/">Wez Furlong</a> has been working on some code that will allow you to consume the frameworks that you can use with Objective-C.&nbsp; With this bridge you can use PHP programming to develop applications.&nbsp; This is a very neat accomplishment by Wez.&nbsp; They have cooked up a small ping class with a GUI front-end.</p>  <p>  While it is still in the early stages you will most likely need a fair amount of C and Objective-C knowledge to make things work.&nbsp; I look forward to seeing how this evolves as time goes on.&nbsp; You can read more about this and see the example images on <a href="http://netevil.org/blog/2007/11/php-objective-c-bridge">Wez's post</a>.</p>
