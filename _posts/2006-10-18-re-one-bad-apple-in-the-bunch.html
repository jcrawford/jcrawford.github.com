<p>Recently I posted an entry <a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/2006/10/11/one-bad-apple-in-the-bunch/" title="One Bad Apple in the Bunch">on here</a> explaining some issues that I have been having with my 23&rdquo; ACD, I had to return it to repair because of image ghosting.&nbsp; I received it back only to find 14 dead pixels and was not happy.</p><p>I had to return the display once again so that they could fix their mistake.&nbsp; I finally got the display back yesterday and found that now I have 6 dead pixels.&nbsp; Why can Apple not get this display fixed properly?</p><p>I am not sure whom I should contact over at Apple to complain about this.&nbsp; I had been dealing with a product specialist named David at extension 41131, however he doesn&rsquo;t seem to care to respond to any of my messages.&nbsp; I will at some point figure out who I should talk to and I will call them.</p><p>At first I thought well I don&rsquo;t want to complain about this because I do not want to be without my display for another 5 days.&nbsp; However the more I think about it the more pissed off I get and feel they should fix the issue, not only that they should do something to make me happy now.&nbsp; They screwed up the repair the first time, by using a defective panel thereby requiring me to be without it for another 5 days.&nbsp; Now I can see how 6 pixels may have been easy to miss, but that does not dismiss the fact that they are there and should be fixed.</p><p>I am not looking forward to being without my display for another 5 days however I will do what I need to in order to get a display that works properly.</p><p>If you know whom I should contact at Apple you can email me at <a href="mailto:info@josephcrawford.com?subject=Apple%20Support%20Contacts" title="info@josephcrawford.com">info@josephcrawford.com</a> or leave comments in this entry.</p>
