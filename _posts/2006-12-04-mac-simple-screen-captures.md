title: Mac Simple Screen Captures
---

While learning to first use the Mac I have come across several nice little shortcuts.  However my favorite is the screen capture utility built into OS X.  On windows if I wanted to take a screen shot I either had to download a 3rd party application or I had to use the print screen button.  The 3rd party application could accomplish what I needed, however print screen could not.  If I used print screen I would have to edit the photo to get the exact thing I wanted.

When using Mac OS X there is a simple keystroke you hit Command-Shift-4 which will give you a cross-hair cursor.  All you have to do at this point is click and drag over whatever it is you want to capture.  When you have what you want highlighted simply let go of the mouse button.  You will hear a sound like that of a camera and you will find your image on your desktop named Picture X.  The X is a number so if you do multiple screen shots you will have Picture 1.png, Picture 2.png, etc.

Well some of you may be saying well that's nice but it's not the fastest method to get a screen shot of an entire application window.  You're right and Apple has a cure for that as well.  If you want to do a screen shot of an entire application window simply issue the command Command-Shift-4 but do not click and drag, instead hit the space bar, it will turn your screen blue.  If you want to capture the current winodw click the mouse otherwise hit the spacebar again to return to the cross hairs so you can select an area to capture.  Also if you started a capture and want to stop you can do so by hitting the exc key.
