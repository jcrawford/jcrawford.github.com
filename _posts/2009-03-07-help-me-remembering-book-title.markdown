I went to B&N last night trying to find this book to read to my step son.  I did not have any luck trying to find the book because I do not know the title.What I do remember about the book is that it was written in a journal format (boy's diary) the boy's father was a truck driver and not around much.  The boy had problems at school with kids taking his lunch from his lunch box so he decided to make a lunchbox alarm and I believe he also used it as a door alarm.I wish I could remember the name of this book so that I could pick up a copy.  I remember reading it when I was about 8 years old so that was about 20 years ago.  I read it around the time that I read pippi long stocking, and the ramona books by beverly cleary and the indian in the cupboard.If anyone knows the title of the book please let me know.  For now I have picked up the Indian in the Cupboard.
