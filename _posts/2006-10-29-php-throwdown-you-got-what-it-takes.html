<p>So there is a new contest that is in the planning and development stages.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s called <a target="_blank" title="PHP Throwdown" href="http://www.phpthrowdown.com">PHP Throwdown</a>, it is a 24 hour coding contest.&nbsp; You can compete either as an individual or a team.&nbsp; The goal is to complete the best application within the 24 hour time period.</p><p>Do you think you have what it takes?&nbsp; I can almost guarantee that the competitors in this contest will only get a few hours sleep (if any) so it will take quite a bit if you plan to take part.</p><p>There will be 4 categories for applications which you can compete in, however they are still to be determined.&nbsp; They also have not disclosed any of the prizes which you will be competing for.&nbsp; I am sure that will come soon.</p><p>I have yet to determine if I will take part in this contenst, I will need to wait and see what the categories are and if I can come up with ideas of what to do.&nbsp; However if I do take part i would want a designer to work with me to make it look good so drop me a line if you would be interested.&nbsp; I would also have to see what the prizes are.</p><p>So when will this contest take place?&nbsp; January 27th 2007 so mark your calendars!</p><p>If you have any ideas on what the categories should be, feel free to drop by <a target="_blank" title="PHP Throwdown" href="http://www.phpthrowdown.com/">the site</a> and contact contest admin.<br />&nbsp;</p>
