<p>As many of you may know in PHP 5.0.2 they introduced a patch that will allow you to monitor file uploads.&nbsp; What is so good about this?&nbsp; Well with PHP being able to monitor the file upload you can actually implement a real progress bar so that users who are uploading large files will see a meter rather than it looking like the page is just hanging there not doing anything. &nbsp;</p><p>I have been trying to find some documentation on this feature so that I could code an example and explain how it is used.&nbsp; However i have been unable to find a whole lot about this topic on the php.net website.&nbsp; Through a search of the mailing lists that I subscribe to I was able to find an example with some source code.&nbsp; What else do you need to implement a progress meter aside from PHP?&nbsp; Well you will need to use some JavaScript.</p><p>JavaScript is not my area of expertise and there is still so much that i need to learn.&nbsp; Due to this fact it will be hard for me to give a real tutorial on this process.&nbsp; Rasmus Lerdorf posted an example of how to implement this on the php.general mailing list.&nbsp; If you look at the source code you will see that it actually uses only a small bit of PHP and uses quite a bit of JavaScript.</p><p>Take the <a href="http://progphp.com/upload.php" title="PHP Upload Progress Meter">demo</a> for a test drive.&nbsp; Once you see this thing in action I am sure you will want to see the <a href="http://progphp.com/upload.phps" title="PHP Upload Progress Meter">source code</a>.&nbsp; I hope that it does not take too long to get some more in depth documentation up on the PHP website.&nbsp; This feature is too nice to not document well.</p><p> <br /></p><br />
