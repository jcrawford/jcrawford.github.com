<p>Today apple released iTunes 7, they also unveiled the ability to download movies on iTunes.&nbsp; I thought they would have offered a higher resolution of 640x480 though.&nbsp; I have yet to check out what the video's look like on my 23&quot; ACD but my guess is they will be pixelated at full screen.&nbsp; That's a dissapointment.&nbsp; I am going to check it out and atleast buy one movie to see what it is like but i think i would still rather buy the DVD for the much higher quality and it is only about $7 more than the digital version.</p><p>We'll see how things go, but i look forward to this service and seeing what movies are released on iTunes.&nbsp;</p>
