<p>I have had Time Machine running since I first installed Leopard 8 days ago.&nbsp; I have had no problems with it however lately I have been getting errors every hour when it tries to do a backup.&nbsp; I thought well maybe the permissions were messed up and went into Disk Utility to repair them.&nbsp; Disk Utility would not allow me to verify or repair the permissions.&nbsp; I am not sure what is going on with this.&nbsp; Have any of you readers seen this happen to you?&nbsp; I tried to get Disk Utility to just repair the disk because it seemed to have issues when I ran verification however it will not unmount the disk.</p>  <p><img style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 1px" src="http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/timemachine.png" alt="Time Machine Error" /></p>  <p>I am not sure what happened with Time Machine however I have fixed it.&nbsp; For some reason it was saying that it could not find the backup volume when i changed the drive and then changed it back quickly so that it would use the same drive.&nbsp; I formatted my backup drive and started time machine over from scratch.&nbsp; I hope that this does not cause any other issues and Time Machine should be smart enough to see that I have deleted the old backups.&nbsp; It is running the initial backup again now so we'll see how things go.&nbsp; I hope this does not happen often because when you delete your backups what is the point of such a program?   </p>
