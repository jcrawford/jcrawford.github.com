Today apple released iTunes 7, they also unveiled the ability to download movies on iTunes.  I thought they would have offered a higher resolution of 640x480 though.  I have yet to check out what the video's look like on my 23" ACD but my guess is they will be pixelated at full screen.  That's a dissapointment.  I am going to check it out and atleast buy one movie to see what it is like but i think i would still rather buy the DVD for the much higher quality and it is only about $7 more than the digital version.

We'll see how things go, but i look forward to this service and seeing what movies are released on iTunes.
