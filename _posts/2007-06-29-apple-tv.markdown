I am glad that I did not buy the Apple TV as soon as it hit the market.Â  I wanted to, however I also wanted to wait a while to see what kind of issues it was going to have with the version 1 release.On my birthday I got the 160GB Apple TV!Â  My woman loves me :)I cannot wait until Charmaine and I can sit down on the couch and watch a movie with the Apple TV.Â  I know the first thing she is going to watch will be The Pursuit of Happyness and I really liked that movie so it is a top choice of mine too.As soon as I take some time to use it I will post a review of the system on here, I am not sure if this version will have the YouTube capability but I sure hope so.I cannot believe that she bought me the pug and then went out and got this too.Â  I gave her crap for spending this much money on me.... Then again who am I to complain lol.Luv Ya Sweetie
