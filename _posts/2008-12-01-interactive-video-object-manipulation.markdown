Adobe has been researching how to modify objects in videos.  This is something that you could do before with some Adobe products however it is very difficult and tedious to accomplish.  This new technique that they came up with makes it very easy.  If you watch the video below you will see what I mean.  This is truly some great stuff.

I love how they manipulate each person near the end of the video to get a photo still making the people look exactly how they want.  Watching this video makes me want to start getting into video editing haha.  I'll stick to the programming aspect of things.  Now they said that they cannot say when or if these features will make it to the Adobe products but my guess is they will and in the near future.
