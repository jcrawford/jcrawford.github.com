title: XpertTech Update
---
Over the past few weeks recruiters from this company started to reach out to me again.  I started emailing them back telling them to leave me alone and it did not help.  Today I tried another tactic.  I told them that if they did not leave me alone I would focus all of my energy on pissing them off.  I blasted them with a few faxes from a free online service showing the link to my [last post about xpertech](http://www.josephcrawford.com/2012/04/13/annoying-recruiters-xperttech/ "Annoying Recruiters (XpertTech)") and I think I might have finally gotten through to them.<!--more-->> Hey Joe,Thanks for getting back to me.  I appreciate the honesty and transparency of your blog to me.  I cannot apologize enough for the inconvenience we have caused you over the last few months.  If it is all comforting, I have already sat down with my VP and discussed this situation with him.  His name is Joe Budzienski and he can be reached at 781-305-3563 or joeb@xperttech.com . I can tell you he is very hands on and very concerned that he could not be reached to rectify this situation much earlier. Joe encourages that you call him to discuss this, but he also understands that you do not wish to be bothered by our company.  It is completely up to you to speak to Joe, but if not, I assure you that I have made it very well known in our database for you not to be contacted by our company.It does bother me as well knowing we have burned a bridge with a very decorated developer.   If over time you would like to work with me directly about opportunities, I would love to help.Again, my apologies and good luck with your current job or any opportunities. Regards,Jared PaveyAll I can say is I really truly hope this is the end, if it's not then I am going to do what I have to do to annoy the hell out of all of their employees every-day for a long time since I am a developer I will automate the piss-off mode :)
