<p>Before I begin you must know that I do not mean any disrespect to any woman who are out there working in a field that is saturated by men.&nbsp; I too agree that women can do anything a man can and that there should be more female programmers.&nbsp; The following is not geared only towards <a href="http://www.phpwomen.org/">phpwomen.org</a> but at others as well.&nbsp; Ok time to start my rant.</p>  <p>When it comes to sexism and racism why must everything be segregated?&nbsp; Women have been programming for years, in fact I know a few (yes i know i used the few word and not many).&nbsp; We now need a site geared only towards women who are programming PHP?&nbsp; If you want to be equal to men, why not join them rather than segregate yourself from them.&nbsp; </p>  <p>Running into this site made me think of a conversation I had a long time ago about <a href="http://www.bet.com/">Black Entertainment Television</a> (BET).&nbsp; Granted it did have it's time and place, back when the arrogant white folk would not let a black man be in movies or on TV.&nbsp; Today however is it just as common to see a black person on TV as it is a white person so what is the need for a tv network like this, or an awards ceremony for this?&nbsp; What do you think the response would be if some white guy started White Entertainment Television (WET).&nbsp; Oh all the sudden we would be racist etc.&nbsp; Recently my roommate stumbled across a forum post where someone called a black person articulate and they were tagged as a racist.&nbsp; The explanation given was that because the black person was called articulate it implied that black people are stupid.&nbsp; This thread made me wonder where things are going, what can you call someone without being racist?  </p>  <p>Back to women programmers.&nbsp; I understand the need to unite with each other and improve the female presence in the php community, I just do not understand why you feel the need to segregate yourself from the guys.&nbsp; I see what you are doing trying to &quot;unite&quot; the women together to form a group, but why not unite with the guys rather than separating the two?</p>  <p>As I said before this is not meant to be directed solely at <a href="http://www.phpwomen.org/">phpwomen.org</a> but rather at today's society.&nbsp; Forget about race, gender, etc and unite as a whole.</p>
