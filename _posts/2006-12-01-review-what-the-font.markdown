This morning I was browsing the web to try to find some cool new things out of sheer boredom.  I actually did find something that I find really cool.  Have you ever been looking at a magazine or brochure and wondered what font they used for certain text?  Using [What The Font](http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/) now you can find out.  Simply scan the item (or save the image if it is already in digital format) and upload it to WTF.  WTF will scan the text in the image and compare it to it's database of fonts to find the best matches for you.  It is not 100% flawless so you may not get the correct font.  However they state that if you cannot find the font using the WTF engine you can always post it in the forums where font enthusiasts will give you help.
> Ever wanted to find a font just like the one used by certain publications, corporations, or ad campaigns? Well now you can, using our WhatTheFont font recognition system. Upload a scanned image of the font and instantly find the closest matches in our database. If WhatTheFont canâ€™t figure it out, you can submit your image to the WhatTheFont Forum where cloak-draped font enthusiasts around the world will help you out!
I tried this service with GoDaddy's logo however it did not work too well since they have more text than just the logo.  I am sure the .com image was getting in the way also.  However the results that it did return were pretty good.

I think this is a great idea and I have to give props to the developers of the site.  It's a pretty cool trick when you can analyze the text on an image character by character.
