We all know about the get a mac advertisements that are all over TV.  They really put thought into the marketing and the planning of every ad that hit tv.  Almost all of them are funny.  Microsoft has come out with it's own commercial in which [Jerry Seinfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Seinfeld) and [Bill Gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates) co star.I am not sure if this is supposed to be a funny advertisement like Apples or not but I did not find this even mildly funny.  The entire ad revolves around Bill Gates buying a pair of shoes at a discount shoe store and Jerry Seinfeld steps in to size his shoes for him.  They find the right size and go on their way.<!--more-->The entire time during the commercial I was thinking just what type of advertisement is this for?  Shoes or computers?  I am not sure this commercial will get consumers to run out and buy a computer, though I expect shoe sales to skyrocket.  Through the entire commercial the only mention of computers is at the end while they are walking out of the store.  Want to know what the reference is?  Watch the movie below.[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afR5J7eskno]
