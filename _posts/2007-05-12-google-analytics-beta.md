title: Google Analytics Beta
---
Recently Google released a beta version of Analytics.Â  I logged in today to see what the fuss was all about.Â  I must say that I think they are doing a great job with the improvements that they are doing.Â  This new beta is not just a round of bug fixes, it is a complete face lift to the interface.The part I love the most is the map overlay.Â  The new map overlay will allow you to click on continents and it will zoom in similar to google maps.Â  When I zoomed in all the way to the United States I could hover over the states and it would show me how many visitors I have had from that state during the date range I had set.If you have not done so you should log in to your analytics account and check out the new beta, it ROCKS!
