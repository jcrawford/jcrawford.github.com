<p>I have recently noticed that iTunes does not store the cover art in the ID3 tag like most other applications.&nbsp; They actually store them in ~/Music/iTunes/Cover Art/, it makes sense to do this since they can query one directory rather than every song's ID3 tag.&nbsp; I am sure performance is a big thing here.&nbsp; However i have opted not to use the iTunes Cover Art.&nbsp; I have been going to amazon and applying the cover art to the ID3 tag, if i move the file i want the art to go with it.&nbsp; Also i have had some issues of iTunes not being able to provide the cover art for certain albums.</p><p>I have also heard reports of people using the cover art and getting the incorrect covers from iTunes.&nbsp; They still need to put a bit more work into the cover art before i will use it...&nbsp;</p>
