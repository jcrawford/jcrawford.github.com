title: Funny Bug in Thunderbird 3
---
Today while I was at work I had to request a particular day off through our online tool.  When the request was approved I received an email from the system which wanted a return read receipt.  I allowed it to send the return recipt and then Thunderbird showed a message stating that it was not a valid address and again I clicked ok.  Once I clicked that I got a very funny message which seems to be a debugging step for the developers on Thunderbird 3.  Look below for a screen shot.Note: If you are from Mozilla and would like more information on how to re-create this please get in touch with me through the comments below.
