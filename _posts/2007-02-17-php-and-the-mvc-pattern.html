I have done quite a bit of reading about using design patterns with PHP.Â  Recently I have once again been looking into using the MVC pattern with PHP 5.  I have started looking at frameworks and choose to start with the Zend Framework.  The documentation for the API seems to be great however the actual how to implement and begin with the framework is not the greatest.  Through Google I have finally figured out how it works and I think it is pretty slick.  I love how it separates everything.  The only thing I am unsure of is each view having it's own template for the page.  All of the tutorials are showing duplicated HTML in templates such as the page header, footer, sidebar etc.  There has to be a way to have multiple components on the site and allow for them to have their own template which would be included in multiple pages.

Maybe I am just thinking too hard about that and it really is simple to do, I will figure it out sooner or later.  If you know of any good resources on the MVC framework and PHP I would appreciate it if you could leave them in the comments so I can check them out.
