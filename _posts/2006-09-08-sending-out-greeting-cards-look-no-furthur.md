title: Sending out greeting cards? Look no furthur!
---

Recently i was at a meeting where someone brought up the website [Send Out Cards](http://www.sendoutcards.com/ "Send Out Cards"), it seemed like a cool idea for just about anyone.  Never again forget to send out those birthday or aniversary cards.  The cool part about this service is that you can customize the cards, you can put a picture on the card (and maybe even design the entire card).  They will print and mail the cards to whomever you wish.  They have an online calendar with an online contact manager.

This service is not only good for consumers who wish to not miss another birthday, but it will also benefit businesses.  It is always nice to send out Thank You cards, or cards to grab a potential customers attention.  Maybe you want to send coupons to your loyal customers.  There are endless possibilities with this.

Also if you would like to make money from this system you can get into this as a distributor, i am not 100% educated on this yet, but will find out more and post again with more details on how you can make money from this.  For now you can check out the [Income Opportunities](https://www.sendoutcards.com/cgi-bin/trncustomer.pl?income_opportunities: "Send Out Cards - Income Opportunity") page for more information
