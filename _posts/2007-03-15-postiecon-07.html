PayPerPost has started up a conference for bloggers.  The conference will be held in Orlando, FL on June 1st and 2nd.  They have a good lineup of speakers to share information with us fellow bloggers.  Why should you attend the conference?  You will learn a lot, get to network with other fellow bloggers.  They will be talking about how to increase the traffic to your blog and what you can do to gain more and more daily readers.

	I wish the conference was closer to me.  I live in VT and the conference would cost a bundle between airfare and hotel on top of the conference fee.  It would be nice to attend this conference though.  Who knows maybe I will make it to PostieCon '08.  This is the first time I have ever heard about a <a href="http://www.postiecon.com">bloggers conference</a> being held anywhere.  The cost of the conference is very cheap compared to most other conferences you are looking to pay $199.95 (currently as posted on their website).

	They have 2 full days of keynotes.  To see the full schedule take a look at the <a href="http://postiecon.com/schedule.html" title="PostieCon Schedule">PostieCon</a> website.  It even looks like these guys know how to have fun.  After 8pm they have a social where it says Ted will be getting naked.  Gee I hope there is alcohol involved for that to happen hehe.
