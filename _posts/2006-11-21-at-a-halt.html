<p>So you may have noticed that my posting on here has slowed down quite a bit.&nbsp; The reason is because we recently relocated.&nbsp; We moved our entire house in 1 day starting at 6:30am and ending at 1:30am.&nbsp; The house is scattered with boxes and we are busy unpacking and organizing everything.&nbsp; I will try to post on here as much as I can however I hope to be back on schedule within a few weeks.&nbsp; Moving an entire house in 1 day was not fun and drained everyone of all the energy they had.&nbsp; I came down with a cold, started to lose my voice.&nbsp; I am also working everyday so I cannot dedicate all of my time to getting this house back in order.</p><p>The last apartment we were at we had to get out of.&nbsp; Not only was rent outrageous for this area ($1200 for 2 bedroom though it included everything) but the landlord was losing grip of everything.&nbsp; I will not go into details but will say that it was tough to get him to fix anything that needed to be fixed.&nbsp; The first 2 years were fine but then things started going down hill.&nbsp; We needed to get a skylight fixed in our daughters room because it was the only means of ventilation in that room.&nbsp; I had to hold back rent to get him to fix it.&nbsp; Even with holding the rent it still took him about 20 days to fix the issue.&nbsp; At the same time I was holding rent, my daughters scooter (gas powered retailed at $400) was in storage downstairs.&nbsp; It became locked behind a chicken wire storage area.&nbsp; I told the landlord he had no right and that I wanted it unlocked.&nbsp; Long story short the scooter came up missing before I ever saw it unlocked.</p><p>I will not deal with a landlord that will steal from a 9 year old or not do anything about his employees stealing from his tenants.&nbsp; I confronted him and he said it was not his problem if one of his guys stole the scooter.</p><p>We are out and couldnt be happier.</p>
