<p>So on Monday (10/09/06) I had to ship my 23&quot; Apple Cinema Display into repair.&nbsp; There was an issue with the image burning into the screen, when I was in full screen mode I could see a ghost image of the menu bar.&nbsp; Up to this point all was going well.&nbsp; I sent it out and received it back very quickly. I was actually surprised that I got it back today (10/11/06).&nbsp; I was very excited to finally have the display back, i set it up immediately and checked to make sure my issue was fixed.&nbsp; The way I checked was that I loaded up a screen saver with a solid black image.&nbsp; Sure enough my issue was gone, however I noticed something else.&nbsp; There were about 5 dead pixels that were very noticeable.&nbsp; I checked the repair sheet and it says that they replaced the LCD module.</p><p>As you can imagine I was not very happy, I immediately called Apple Support.&nbsp; They went through their routine of talking with the product specialist and even the tech couldn&rsquo;t believe that I received it back from repair in this condition.&nbsp; While I was on hold I did a much finer inspection and found there to be 14 dead pixels scattered across the screen.&nbsp; After a while I was on the phone with the actual product specialist and they apologized up and down saying that they would make sure that it was fixed properly this time.&nbsp; This was not acceptable as they introduced this new issue when they obviously used a defective LCD panel.&nbsp; From my point of view accidents happen, BUT this could have easily been avoided had they tested the display AT ALL they would have noticed these.&nbsp; Whomever the tech was that worked on my display needs to take a bit more time and go over the issue, make sure it's fixed and that they don&rsquo;t introduce something as blatantly obvious as this.</p><p>I am not very happy that I have to be without my display for ANOTHER 3-5 days, I just hope they fix it right this time.&nbsp; I DO NOT want to have to return it yet again.&nbsp; Also one thing that bothers me (doesn't really anger me) is the fact that they screwed up and they didn&rsquo;t offer anything in return.&nbsp; Most companies will offer you something free when they make a mistake like this.&nbsp; I guess they don&rsquo;t do that.</p>
