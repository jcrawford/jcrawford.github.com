![Broken Arm](http://www.josephcrawford.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/photo-42.jpg)Friday night I went to see my boys and we went to McDonalds in Rutland.  I was too big to take Paxton into the play place tunnels so my girl Claire took him in.  They were in a glass bubble so I pulled myself up onto one of the bars so that he could see me and I could make him laugh.  I was there for a few minutes and then decided to hop down, when I did my arm caught on one of the bars that went to a T and I heard "crack".  My fingers started to tingle so I said we have to go to Claire.  She thought we were getting kicked out for her being in the tunnels.  When I told her that I broke my arm she thought I was joking.  The guy that was sitting about 30 feet away confirmed to her that he heard it break.  I went to the ER and they confirmed that it was broken.  I broke the big bone in my forearm on the inside near my thumb.  I have it in a splint, I wouldn't let them cast it because the cast would not allow me to type because it goes over your knuckles.  If I cannot type I cannot work and well I need to work. 
  
The doctor that saw me looked at my x-ray and said that I needed to go see an orthopedic surgeon to have surgery.  He said they were going to wrap the bone with a metal plate.  I am not going to do that.  I already have one metal plate on my collar bone from a car accident and in the winter I really feel the cold weather.  I looked at the x-ray and it looks like a small fracture, I think they just want to bump up the bills hehe.
