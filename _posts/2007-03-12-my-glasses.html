I never knew that glasses were so expensive.  Even with my insurance through work I ended up paying $300 for my every-day pair.  I could not go without sunglasses though and i had to drop another $500 on those.  With the sunglasses what I had to do was buy a pair of Revo and then have Lens Crafters send them out to have the lenses made to fit the frames.  You can also get a pair of <a href="http://www.opticsplanet.net/discount-sunglasses.html">Discount Sunglasses</a> for every-day use or to have prescription lenses place into them.Â  I found that these guys have much better prices on the name brand glasses for every place that I have checked.

	I have already dropped my sun glasses and put a nice scratch in one of the lenses.  I should have known to get the straps for them because I always put them on my head and then when I turn around they go flying.  I just could not believe that I had to buy the frames from another store and then take them to Lens Crafters to have them put the new lenses in them.  The store I bought them from is owned by Lens Crafters so you would think that they could order just the frames from Revo to make the cost lower.  When you buy a $230 pair of sunglasses you are paying mainly for the lenses.

	Lens Crafters did not even return the non prescription lenses to me in new condition.  They decided to put both lenses in a plastic bag and send them that way.  Through shipping the lenses clanked together leaving nice scratches in each other so I cannot even sell the lenses on eBay to make up the costs.  I am not satisfied with Lens Crafters and I am going to be calling or emailing corporate to let them know.
