I am not sure which you will choose to be the next media for audio and video content.  Both of these formats are fighting to replace the current DVD format that we are so used to using.  There are a few differences between the two, mainly the storage capacity.  It seems that Blu-Ray can hold quite a bit more than the HD-DVD.  Below you will find the specifications for each type of disk.
Blu-Ray
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="dataTable"><tr><th>Physical Size</th><th>Single Layer Capacity</th><th>Dual Layer Capacity</th></tr><tr><td>12cm, Single Sided</td><td>25 GB</td><td>50 GB</td></tr><tr><td>12cm, Double Sided</td><td>50 GB</td><td>100 GB</td></tr><tr><td>8cm, Single Sided</td><td>7.8 GB</td><td>15.6 GB</td></tr><tr><td>8cm, Double Sided</td><td>15.6 GB</td><td>31.2 GB</td></tr></table>
HD-DVD
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="0" class="dataTable"><tr><th>Physical Size</th><th>Single Layer Capacity</th><th>Dual Layer Capacity</th></tr><tr><td>12cm, Single Sided</td><td>15 GB</td><td>30 GB</td></tr><tr><td>12cm, Double Sided</td><td>30 GB</td><td>60 GB</td></tr><tr><td>8cm, Single Sided</td><td>4.7 GB</td><td>9.4 GB</td></tr><tr><td>8cm, Double Sided</td><td>9.4 GB</td><td>18.8 G</td></tr></table>As you can see the Blu-Ray disk will hold about 2/3 more than the HD-DVD which is why I am hoping that the Blu-Ray disk will replace the current DVD format.  Now as you know neither of these are really main-stream and no one knows which will replace the DVD.  However I found out today that BOTH of them are already cracked, below is an excerpt from the site.<div>{democracy:6}</div><!--more-->>  Blu-ray and HD DVD copy protection cracked "A computer hacker claims to have broken the AACS (Advanced Access Content System) encryption specification used to control unauthorised copying on HD DVD and Blu-ray video players," Robert McMillan reports for Macworld UK."The hacker, who goes by the name of Muslix64, said he wrote the software earlier this month after hardware compatibility problems made it impossible for him to play HD DVDs on an Xbox that was connected to his PC," McMillan reports.McMillan continues, "Muslix64 has posted a video purporting to show the software decrypting a copy of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film Full Metal Jacket. This development is a black eye for the new optical disc formats, which are both jockeying to be successor to the DVD. The Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, the group that sets the AACS specification, could not be reached for comment."This makes me wonder if they will "really" be able to stop people from copying their movies, music, etc.  I for one am glad that it is cracked.  The MPAA and RIAA are trying everything they can to keep people from pirating music and movies that consumers who buy the product and wish to make a backup copy suffer.  As a consumer we have the legal right to make a personal backup of "ANY" media that we purchase.  The companies are just trying to protect themselves from illegal copies of the media which I can understand, however don't make the honest consumer suffer.  It is still possible to make backup copies of your media thanks to those who crack the protection.In my opinion the companies will never stop the media from being pirated, they are just wasting their money and causing the cost of the media to increase for consumers.  If people are going to pirate the media they are going to do it.  Why spend so much money trying to stop something you cannot stop?  In the past they have tried to track down the people who are sharing the media and they have served them with lawsuits, yes they served the average Joe with a lawsuit.  The issue with that is they can never be 100% sure that the person they are suing is the person sharing the files.  I mean at one point I remember reading about them serving an 80 year old woman a notice, and even someone who had passed away.Give it up, spend the money creating more and more movies and or music records.  You will always lose money to pirating just like stores will always lose money to shop-lifters.
