If you have seen my resume you will be saying (^*&%$%*&*(* and pulling out your hair asking why I would add yet another employer to my resume.  I feel the same way!  I have been trying to find the employer where I could be with for years and count on the stability.  In 2008 I was working for Castle Communications and had been with them for over a year before getting the layoff e-mail. However starting Feb. 22nd 2010 I am glad to announce that I will be starting with [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/) after my trip to Florida next week. I am looking forward to working with the highly intelligent team that they have built and I am very excited to start with a company as large and stable as [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/).I am afraid I will not be allowed to really talk about what I am doing at work due to confidentiality agreements etc. however I will make posts updating you of things I have worked on once they have launched and are out of the reign of the agreements.
