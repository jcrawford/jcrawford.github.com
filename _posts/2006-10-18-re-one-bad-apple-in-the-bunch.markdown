Recently I posted an entry [on here](http://www.josephcrawford.com/2006/10/11/one-bad-apple-in-the-bunch/ "One Bad Apple in the Bunch") explaining some issues that I have been having with my 23” ACD, I had to return it to repair because of image ghosting.  I received it back only to find 14 dead pixels and was not happy.

I had to return the display once again so that they could fix their mistake.  I finally got the display back yesterday and found that now I have 6 dead pixels.  Why can Apple not get this display fixed properly?

I am not sure whom I should contact over at Apple to complain about this.  I had been dealing with a product specialist named David at extension 41131, however he doesn’t seem to care to respond to any of my messages.  I will at some point figure out who I should talk to and I will call them.

At first I thought well I don’t want to complain about this because I do not want to be without my display for another 5 days.  However the more I think about it the more pissed off I get and feel they should fix the issue, not only that they should do something to make me happy now.  They screwed up the repair the first time, by using a defective panel thereby requiring me to be without it for another 5 days.  Now I can see how 6 pixels may have been easy to miss, but that does not dismiss the fact that they are there and should be fixed.

I am not looking forward to being without my display for another 5 days however I will do what I need to in order to get a display that works properly.

If you know whom I should contact at Apple you can email me at [info@josephcrawford.com](mailto:info@josephcrawford.com?subject=Apple%20Support%20Contacts "info@josephcrawford.com") or leave comments in this entry.
