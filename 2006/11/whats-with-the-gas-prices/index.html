<p>Ok so this is not a normal post for me but I am getting so sick of what the oil companies are doing to us.</p>

<p>First of all let&#39;s have a quick poll.

Now last night i went to the gas station and noticed gas was $2.15 / gal. I keep hearing everyone say that is a good price for gas, they are glad to see that the price is back down again.  Before Hurricane Katrina, our gas prices were somewhere between $1.90 - $2.00, then the oil companies gouged the hell out of the price making it close to $3.00 / gal.</p>

<p>Everyone complained about the high gas prices, hell even I did.There was no need for the gas prices to go that high, they were just gouging the prices trying to make up for a loss they did not want to get hit with.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Over the passed few months we have been seeing the gas prices slowly drop.  Finally settling at the $2.10 - $2.15 range.</p>

<p>Everyone seems so happy, the consumer and the oil companies…   WAIT! All the oil company is doing is marking the price of gas to be really high for a while, getting you somewhat used to that price and then lowering it back down to a lower price, but still higher than before the price sky rocketed.</p>

<p>I am not sure why so many people are happy.  I am guessing they are happy not because gas is $2.15 per gallon, but for the fact that they do not have to pay $3 per gallon.</p>

<p>There is not another industry I know that this would work in.  I know in web development this would not fly.  If we were to buy a slice of pizza and it went from $3 to $6 for a slice, most of us would say screw it.</p>

<p>However you cannot work without gas, and without work well, then you have nothing.</p>
