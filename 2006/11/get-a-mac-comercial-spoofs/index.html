<p>Today someone posted a link on an IRC channel and ofcourse I had to check it out.  Now I love my Mac and do not regret the switch.  The one thing Apple has going is a good marketing campaign with the new Get A Mac commercials.  Some like them and some dont.  I personally love them.  Besides being true they are also humerous.</p>

<p>Someone decided to spend some time and write a few spoof sketches for the Get A Mac commercials.  Among them is my favorite Performance.  I almost lost it while watching these.  My only question is why they are being so rough on linux?  It is a good OS, it is becoming more and more poular as a desktop, i find it to be a lot faster and more stable than windows.</p>

<p>The one point that they bring up is that you cannot play many games on the Mac, I think you will see that change in the near future with the migration to the Intel processors.  However if it doesn&#39;t change just dont get a Mac ;)  Mac users do not buy them for their gaming ability, they buy them for performance and stability, oh and that sexy look of OS X.</p>
