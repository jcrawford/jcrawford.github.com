<p>Over the last week I read that Microsoft copied an Apple icon and posted it on the Microsoft website.  Why anyone would do this is beyond me.  Did you think it would go unnoticed?</p>

<p>It was bad enough that they used an Apple icon on their website but what I came across today is just unbelievable.  Can Microsoft really not come up with their own ideas?</p>

<p>Microsoft has filmed a commercial much like the Get A Mac commercials.  This one I guess is meant to be a parody showing that the Zune is supposedly better than the iPod.

All I can say is that I cannot believe the crap Microsoft tries to pull.  I never knew about any of this stuff until I made the migration over to the Mac platform.  So do you think the Zune is better than the iPod?  I guess only the holiday sales will tell that story.
