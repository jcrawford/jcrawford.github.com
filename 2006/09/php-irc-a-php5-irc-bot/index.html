<p>So the other day i stumbled accross something called PHP-IRC, it is a full blown PHP 5 IRC Bot.  I know there are some people out there who say now why would you use PHP for an IRC Bot.  The more important question is WHY NOT?  This bot is coded really well, it will work on windows, linux, mac, probably any OS that can run PHP.  I have it loaded up and have began looking over the plugin structure and it is really nice.  When i say this is a full blown IRC Bot i mean it.  Some of the features are listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li>DCC Chat Support with custom DCC Chat handlers</li>
<li>DCC File transfer support (inc. mIRC Rev. Protocol)</li>
<li>Modular based function support</li>
<li>Event based, with user-definable event handling</li>
<li>Full support for timers</li>
<li>Channel and user tracking, with user modes and count</li>
<li>Multiple bots under one process</li>
<li>Remote admin via DCC Chat or private message</li>
<li>MySQL support</li>
<li>Very in-depth documentation</li>
<li>... and much more!
I am looking at making a few plugins for this bot, and will release them on this site when they are done.  Think about the ability to have the bot store channel statistics in a database, or reach out and check your RSS Feeds for you.  There is a lot you could do with this feature and you wouldnt have to load up a webpage to do anything, it can all be done in IRC via DCC Chat :D</li>
</ul>
