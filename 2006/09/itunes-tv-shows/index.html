<p>Recently i found that <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="Apple iTunes">iTunes</a> offers TV Shows which you can purchase and download to your computer for viewing on your computer or video iPod.  Most of the episodes that i looked at were $1.99 which is reasonably priced.  I am not sure if <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a> controls the quality of the video&#39;s (i doubt it) but i think they should set up some restriction on the quality.  While viewing the episode on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" title="Apple iPod">iPod</a> screen is pretty good, if you load the same video up onto a 23&quot; <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/" title="Apple Cinema Display">ACD</a> you need to make the window very small to have good quality.  I think that <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a> should increase the quality of the episodes so that you can watch them on your computer, either at full screen or atleast half screen with good quality.  I wouldnt mind paying more for better quality.  You can optionally buy each episode at $1.99 or you can buy the entire season for a discounted price.  The season prices ranged from about $24.99 - $34.99 which is still cheaper than going out to buy the seasons on DVD.  I have been unable to test the quality of the episodes on a TV because i do not have the hardware for doing so.  I will personally stick to my TV and DVR for the television shows, it has much better quality than the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/" title="Apple iTunes">iTunes</a> TV episodes.  Maybe one day <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a> will get better quality versions on the online store.  Maybe they should offer 2 versions one for the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" title="Apple iPod">iPod</a> (low quality) and one for the computer displays/tv (high quality)  I could see them charging $1.99 for the iPod version and $3.99 for the high quality versions as it would require more bandwidth for each download.

High quality means that i could hook my computer to my TV and watch the episodes there, or if i am lazy and do not want to move i could watch them on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/displays/" title="Apple Cinema Display">Cinema Display</a> sitting in front of the computer.  If you want good quality so you can watch these on anything other than your <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipod/" title="Apple iPod">iPod</a> i suggest you go out and buy the seasons on DVD, or get a DVR service so you can record the episodes while you are out.  This is the route i will be going for now.  We&#39;ll see what the future holds and whether or not <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a> offers higher quality video&#39;s.</p>

<p>I just hope that if <a href="http://www.apple.com/" title="Apple Computer">Apple</a> does launch the movie service i have been hearing about (where you can buy a movie for $9.99) that the quality is MUCH better than the TV episodes they offer.  I think that quality is what will hold them back. </p>
