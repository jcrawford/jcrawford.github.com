<p>I am a supporter of Bernie Sanders over Rich Tarrant however something on the news tonight got to me.  Bernie said he would set a law restricting US businesses from using people overseas as contractors.  I totally agree that large corporations should not be able to run sweat shops.  However I have a few people in other countries who do work for me, they do good work.  I am not saying that US citizens do not do good work.  Why should we be penalized for using people overseas who do GOOD work...  Also Bernie needs to think if he disables us from employing any of them, how much work will we lose.  I know i get work from Canada and the UK so if we cannot employ thier citizens why would they use US businesses for thier needs?  In IT there is more to think about than what he is. </p>

<p>The reason i choose Bernie Sanders over Rich Tarrant is because Rich started with the negative ad&#39;s and thinks his money can get him whatever he wants.  Also if you check Bernie&#39;s record for voting you will see that the reason he voted the way he did is because they bundle several things together.  I am not a very political person nor do i really care about it, but when it effects my life i care.  As for the Amber Alert Bernie does support it.  But when they bundle several things like let&#39;s let more people live on welfare and also support the Amber Alert what do you do?  Why bundle them together just vote on each item, that would take care of things.</p>
