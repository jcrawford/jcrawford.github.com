<p>Re: One Bad Apple in the Bunch</p>

<p>Yesterday I called into Apple to check the status of my display repair.  I spoke with an apple rep who told me that the display was repaired and was now in the diagnostic department being tested.  This morning I got a call from Nate Doss who is an Apple Executive Rep.  He told me that the LCD Modules were on back order, however they were going to send me a new display so that I would not have to wait.  </p>

<p>Last time I talked to Nate he said that Apple was going to offer me a Good Will Gesture from Apple.  It seemed like the replacement display was that gesture.  I was not happy because I felt it was their responsibility to give me a non defective display since I paid $1200 for the display in the first place.</p>

<p>I was very unhappy so I emailed Nate, they are going to replace the display and we will discuss a good will gesture after I get the display and I am happy with the quality.  We will see where things go from there.</p>

<p>I have been really unhappy with the support from Apple.  I bought the display from Apple at a premium price (even though i knew other manufacturers used the same LCD Module in their displays which cost less)  I figured i would get good support for the offset in price.  The next display i get will probably not be an Apple Display.  I do not feel that for the money I have invested that I should have to go through experiences like this.  I understand that some products are defective, but when you have a technician go over the product, fix it 3 times and send it back to me with other obvious issued, there is something wrong.</p>

<p> Stay tuned for more updates...  How many of you actually care about this anyway.</p>
