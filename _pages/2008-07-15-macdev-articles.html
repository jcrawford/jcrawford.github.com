In this section you will find some articles that I have written about MacDev.  I am starting to get into this and thought that the best way to learn would be to document what I have learned for others to benefit from.  In the beginning it is going to be very basic stuff but as I learn more it will get more complex.<br/>

Here are the articles:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.josephcrawford.com/macdev-articles/using-foundations-nslog-function/" title="Foundation's NSLog Function">Using Foundations NSLog Function</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://josephcrawford.com/macdev-articles/cocoa-objects/" title="Cocoa Objects">Cocoa Objects</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://josephcrawford.com/macdev-articles/looking-at-nsobject/" title="Looking at NSObject">Looking at NSObject</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://josephcrawford.com/macdev-articles/google-maps-in-a-cocoa-application/" title="Google Maps in a Cocoa Application">Google Maps in a Cocoa Application</a></li>
</ul>
