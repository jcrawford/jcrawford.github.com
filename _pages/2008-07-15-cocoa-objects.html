<p>Coco Objects are actually pretty easy when you think about it.  Every object has properties and or methods that can be called.  When instantiating a cocoa object you have to allocate it and then initialize it.  You can do that in a few ways but the most common way is to use a single line.  Below is showing how you can instanciate an NSNumber Object.
[objc]
// Method #1 - Prefered Method
NSNumber *number = [[NSNumber alloc] init];

// Method #2
NSNumber *number = [NSNumber alloc];
[number init];

// Method #3
NSNumber *number;
[number alloc];
[number init];
[/objc]
</p>
<p>In the code above you can see why method #1 is the preferred way, it is the easiest to read.  Basically when instantiating an object in Objective-C you are saying I am creating a variable called number which is going to hold a value of type NSNumber.  In the code to the right of the equals sign you are allocating and initializing the actual object.  Pretty easy huh?</p>
